Description: This is an R package that utilises Large Language Models to assist
    with data extraction during meta-analysis. This package incorporates three
    modular Shiny apps to implement a human-in-the-loop framework. (1) a manual
    extraction interface for abstracts, (2) refining prompt engineering and model
    selection, and (3) validation of LLM-generated outputs. These apps enable
    researchers to iteratively collaborate with LLMs, with each abstract
    undergoing double data extraction—once manually by a human researcher and once
    independently by an LLM-assisted process—to emulate the double extraction
    process recommended by international standards. Notably, the package runs
    fully on local machines, with no need for API setup or external data transfer,
    maximising data privacy and accessibility. Robust logging features further
    enhance transparency and reproducibility by recording all prompt iterations
    and outputs.
