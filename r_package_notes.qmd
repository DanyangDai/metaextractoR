## Notes for creating a package

Following the guideline recommanded by [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org)

-   Use `load_all()` for loading in functions created in the R folder.

-   Use `check()` to see if there is any errors and warnings with the current version of the package.

-   Use `use_package()` for prerequisite packages.

-   `use_r()`, `use_test()` and `use_package` for check dependencies.

-   check R package name avaiability: `available("metaextractoR")`: all good to go.

### Package components

-   R code: organise by family of functions.

-   Code styling: `usethis::use_tidy_style()`

-   DO NOT USE: `library`, `require` and `source`

-   The `with_*()`functions: don't think I understand it well enough. Need Emi to double check where it needs to be replaced with `with_*()` functions.

### Package data

-   I will put together some example data: `usethis::use_data(my_pkg_data)` automatically create the data folder and data file.

-   How to document the data? Where the documentation for the data goes?

-   File path for process data storage. In the pre_processing.R function scrip, I have defined the file path. Might need to use `pkg_example` to check the paths. Not sure if it is appropriate. @Emi could you please help and check it please? :pleading_face:

### Metadata - DESCRIPTION

-   Imports: all required packages. Add additional versions.

-   SystemRequirements: what environment is needed to run this package? @Emi, please help :pleading_face:

-  Use `pak::pkg_deps_tree()` to check dependies 


### Metadata - NAMESPACE

- How do I know what to put in to my NAMESPACE? 
  - `export()`
  - `S3method()`
  - `importFrom()`
  - `import()`
  - `useDynLib()`
