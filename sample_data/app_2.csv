"Circulating dipeptidyl peptidase 3 and bio-adrenomedullin levels are associated with impaired outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a prospective international multicentre study","van Lier, D.; Deniau, B.; Santos, K.; Hartmann, O.; Dudoignon, E.; Depret, F.; Plaud, B.; Laterre, P.-F.; Mebazaa, A.; Pickkers, P.","Introduction Dipeptidyl peptidase-3 (DPP3) is a protease involved in the degradation of several cardiovascular mediators. Adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) is a peptide essential for regulation of endothelial barrier function. In different shock-pathologies, both biomarkers are associated with disease severity, organ dysfunction and mortality. Associations with outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients are unknown. The objectives of the present study were to investigate associations of bio-ADM and “circulating DPP3” (cDPP3) with short-term outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients (n=80). Methods A multicentre prospective cohort study was performed. The primary end-point was 28-day mortality. Secondary end-points included different severities of acute kidney injury (AKI). Results cDPP3 levels were mainly associated with 28-day mortality; Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) of 0.69 (0.56–0.82, p=0.023), 0.77 (0.64–0.90, p<0.001) and 0.81 (0.65–0.96, p<0.001) at admission, day 3 and day 7, respectively. In contrast, bio-ADM levels were mainly associated with AKI, with AUROCs of 0.64 (0.51–0.77, p=0.048), 0.75 (0.64–0.86, p<0.001) and 0.83 (0.74–0.93, p<0.001) for day 1, 3 and 7, respectively. Interestingly, patients with high levels of both cDPP3 and bio-ADM at day 7 had an additionally increased risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio 11.8; 95% CI 2.5–55.3, p<0.001). Conclusions cDPP3 and bio-ADM responses were associated with short-term mortality and AKI in critically ill COVID-19 patients, respectively. These findings suggest that treatment with specific antibodies modulating cDPP3 or bio-ADM-related pathways may improve outcome of COVID-19.",2023,NA,"ERJ Open Research","10.1183/23120541.00342-2022",80,34,"Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Role of increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation on acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients","Kim, I.S.; Kim, D.H.; Lee, H.W.; Kim, S.G.; Kim, Y.K.; Kim, J.-K.","Background: A strong association between elevated neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) levels and poor clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported. However, while acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication of COVID-19, the role of NETs in COVID-19-associated AKI is unclear. We investigated the association between elevated NETs and AKI and the prognostic role of NETs in COVID-19 patients. Methods: Two representative markers of NETs, circulating nucleosomes and myeloperoxidase-DNA, were measured in 115 hospitalized patients. Serum levels of interleukin [IL]-6, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 [MCP-1], plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) and urinary biomarkers of renal tubular damage (β2-microglobulin [β2M] and kidney injury molecule 1 [KIM-1]) were measured. Results: AKI was found in 43 patients (37.4%), and pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD) was a strong risk factor for AKI. Higher circulating NET levels were a significant predictor of increased risk of initial ICU admission, in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR 3.21, 95% CI 1.08–9.19) and AKI (OR 3.67, 95% CI 1.30-10.41), independent of age, diabetes, pre-existing CKD and IL-6 levels. There were strong correlations between circulating nucleosome levels and urinary KIM-1/creatinine (r=0.368, p=0.001) and β2M (r=0.218, p=0.049) levels. NETs were also strongly closely associated with serum vWF (r = 0.356, p<0.001), but not with IL-6 or MCP-1 levels. Conclusions: Elevated NETs were closely associated with AKI, which was a strong predictor of mortality. The close association between NETs and vWF may suggest a role for NETs in COVID-19-associated vasculopathy leading to AKI.",2023,NA,"Frontiers in Immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2023.1122510",115,43,"ICU and general hospitaliation",67.6,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Acute kidney injury in Coronavirus disease-19 related pneumonia in the intensive care unit: a retrospective multicenter study, Saudi Arabia","Eldaboosy, S.A.M.; Awad, A.; Farouk, A.; Mahdy, W.; Abdelsalam, E.; Nour, S.O.; Kabil, A.; Taha, A.; Makled, S.; Lotfi, A.; Nabway, U.; Kanany, H.","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) poses a significant morbidity and mortality risk to critically ill COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of AKI in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study in Saudi Arabia of adult patients aged at least 18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and admitted to the intensive care unit between May 2020 and May 2021 was conducted. The occurrence of AKI and associated risk factors, the need for continous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and the outcome were reported. Results: The study included 340 patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Their mean age was 66.7±13.4 years, ranging from 49 to 84 years, and most of them were men (63.8%). The most common concomitant diseases were hypertension (71.5%), diabetes (62.4%), IHD (37.6%), CKD (20%), heart failure (19.4%), and 81.2% suffered from ARDS. AKI occurred in 60.3% of patients, 38% were stage 1, 16.6% were stage 2, and 45.4% were stage 3. Approximately, 39% of patients required CRRT, out of which 76.2% were stage 3, which was significantly higher than the other stages (p<0.001). AKI patients suffered significantly from asthma and had lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and higher creatinine levels than patients without AKI (p<0.05 all). The overall mortality rate was 39.4%, and the mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with AKI than in patients without AKI (48.3% versus 25.9%; p<0.001). Conclusion: AKI is common in adults admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 and is associated with an increased risk of death. Early detection of AKI and appropriate treatment can positively impact COVID-19 outcome.

"Impact of Dexamethasone and Inhaled Nitric Oxide on Severe Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19","Bobot, M.; Tonon, D.; Peres, N.; Guervilly, C.; Lefèvre, F.; Max, H.; Bommel, Y.; Volff, M.; Leone, M.; Lopez, A.; Simeone, P.; Carvelli, J.; Chopinet, S.; Hraiech, S.; Papazian, L.; Velly, L.; Bourenne, J.; Forel, J.-M.","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the second most frequent condition after acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 and is strongly associated with mortality. The aim of this multicentric study was to assess the impact of the specific treatments of COVID-19 and ARDS on the risk of severe AKI in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this cohort study, data from consecutive patients older than 18 years admitted to 6 ICUs for COVID-19-related ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were included. The incidence and severity of AKI, defined according to the 2012 KDIGO definition, were monitored during the entire ICU stay until day 90. Patients older than 18 years admitted to the ICU for COVID-19-related ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation were included. Results: 164 patients were included in the final analysis; 97 (59.1%) displayed AKI, of which 39 (23.8%) had severe stage 3 AKI, and 21 (12.8%) required renal replacement therapy (RRT). In univariate analysis, severe AKI was associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) exposure (p = 0.016), arterial hypertension (p = 0.029), APACHE-II score (p = 0.004) and mortality at D28 (p = 0.008), D60 (p < 0.001) and D90 (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with the onset of stage 3 AKI were: exposure to ACEI (OR: 4.238 (1.307–13.736), p = 0.016), APACHE II score (without age) (OR: 1.138 (1.044–1.241), p = 0.003) and iNO (OR: 5.694 (1.953–16.606), p = 0.001).

The COVID-19 vaccines may improve concerns about the pandemic. However, the roles of inactivated vaccines in older patients (aged ≥60 years) with infection of Delta variant were less studied. METHODS: We classified the older patients with infection of Delta variant into three groups based on the vaccination status: no vaccination (group A, n = 113), one dose of vaccination (group B, n = 46), and two doses of vaccination (group C, n = 22). Two inactivated COVID-19 vaccines (BBIBP-CorV or CoronaVac) were evaluated in this study. The demographic data, laboratory parameters, and clinical severity were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 181 older patients with infection of Delta variant were enrolled. 111 (61.3%) patients had one or more co-morbidities. The days of ""turn negative"" and hospital stay in Group C were lower than those in the other groups (P < 0.05). The incidences of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and cardiac injury in Group A were higher than those in the other groups (P < 0.05). The MV-free days and ICU-free days during 28 days in Group A were also lower than those in the other groups (P < 0.05). In patients with co-morbidities, vaccinated cases had lower incidences of MODS (P = 0.015), septic shock (P = 0.015), and ARDS (P = 0.008).

"Evolving Risk of Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients: A Single Center Retrospective Study","Algahtani, F.D.; Elabbasy, M.T.; Alshammari, F.; Atta, A.; El-Fateh, A.M.; Ghoniem, M.E.","Background and Objectives: Within a year, COVID-19 has advanced from an outbreak to a pandemic, spreading rapidly and globally with devastating impact. The pathophysiological link between COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI) is currently being debated among scientists. While some studies have concluded that the mechanisms of AKI in COVID-19 patients are complex and not fully understood, others have claimed that AKI is a rare complication of COVID-19-related disorders. Considering this information gap and its possible influence on COVID-19-associated AKI management, our study aimed to explore the prevalence of AKI and to identify possible risk factors associated with AKI development among COVID-19 hospitalized patients. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study included 83 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the isolation department in a tertiary hospital in Zagazig City, Egypt between June and August 2020. Patients younger than 18 years of age, those diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease, or those on nephrotoxic medications were excluded. All study participants had a complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, hemostasis parameters examined, inflammatory markers, serum electrolytes, routine urinalysis, arterial blood gas, and non-enhanced chest and abdominal computer tomography (CT) scans. Results: Of the 83 patients, AKI developed in 24 (28.9%) of them, of which 70.8% were in stage 1, 8.3% in stage 2, and 20.8% in stage 3. Patients with AKI were older than patients without AKI, with hypertension and diabetes being the most common comorbidities. Risk factors for AKI include increased age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and a higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Conclusions: AKI occurs in a considerable percentage of patients with COVID-19, especially in elderly males, those with hypertension, diabetes, and a higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Hence, the presence of AKI should be taken into account as an important index within the risk spectrum of disease severity for COVID-19 patients.",2022,NA,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)","10.3390/medicina58030443",83,24,"No",52.9,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated the incidence of AKI in 223 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and analyzed the influence factors of AKI. The incidence of cytokine storm syndrome and its correlation with other clinicopathologic variables were also investigated. We retrospectively enrolled adult patients with virologically confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized at three hospitals in Wuhan and Guizhou, China between February 13, 2020, and April 8, 2020. We included 124 patients with moderate COVID-19 and 99 with severe COVID-19. AKI was present in 35 (15.7%) patients. The incidence of AKI was 30.3% for severe COVID-19 and 4.0% for moderate COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, cytokine storm was found in 30 (13.5%) patients and only found in the severe group. Kidney injury at admission (odds ratio [OR]: 3.132, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.150–8.527; p = 0.025), cytokine storm (OR: 4.234, 95% CI: 1.361–13.171; p = 0.013), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR: 7.684, 95% CI: 2.622–22.523; p < 0.001) were influence factors of AKI. Seventeen (48.6%) patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation developed AKI, of whom 64.7% (11/17) died. Up to 86.7% of AKI patients with cytokine storms may develop a secondary bacterial infection.

Method: We established a retrospective cohort of 408 patients who were admitted to Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China, between January 1 and March 31, 2020. Clinical outcomes and renal function were monitored until April 12, 2020, with a median follow-up duration of 21 days [interquartile range (IQR) = 14–33]. Results: When first admitted to hospital (baseline), 19.36% (79/408) presented renal dysfunction [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <90 ml/min/1.73 m2]. During follow-up, 3.9% (16/408) developed acute kidney injury (AKI).
