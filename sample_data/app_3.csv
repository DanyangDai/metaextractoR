"Development of a Risk Score for AKI onset in COVID-19 Patients: COV-AKI Score","Palomba, H.; Cubos, D.; Bozza, F.; Zampieri, F.G.; Romano, T.G.","Purpose: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the present study, we aimed to develop a prognostic score to predict AKI development in these patients. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective observational study of 2334 COVID 19 patients admitted to 23 different hospitals in Brazil, between January 10th and August 30rd, 2020. The primary outcome of AKI was defined as any increase in serum creatinine (SCr) by 0.3 mg/dL within 48 h or a change in SCr by ≥ 1.5 times of baseline within 1 week, based on Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. All patients aged ≥ 18 y/o admitted with confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection were included. Discrimination of variables was calculated by the Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC curve) utilizing area under curve. Some continuous variables were categorized through ROC curve. The cutoff points were calculated using the value with the best sensitivity and specificity. Results: A total of 1131 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU were included. Patients mean age was 52 ± 15,8 y/o., with a prevalence of males 60% (n = 678). The risk of AKI was 33% (n = 376), 78% (n = 293) of which did not require dialysis. Overall mortality was 11% (n = 127), while for AKI patients, mortality rate was 21% (n = 80). Variables selected for the logistic regression model and inclusion in the final prognostic score were the following: age, diabetes, ACEis, ARBs, chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Conclusion: AKI development in COVID 19 patients is accurately predicted by common clinical variables, allowing early interventions to attenuate the impact of AKI in these patients.",2023,NA,"BMC Nephrology","10.1186/s12882-023-03095-4","#3896",NA,NA,NA,NA,1131,376,TRUE,52

The objective of the study was to determine the factors associated with AKI in patients with COVID-19. Methodology: A retrospective cohort was established in two university hospitals in Bogotá, Colombia. Adults hospitalized for more than 48 h from March 6, 2020, to March 31, 2021, with confirmed COVID-19 were included. The main outcome was to determine the factors associated with AKI in patients with COVID-19 and the secondary outcome was estimate the incidence of AKI during the 28 days following hospital admission. Results: A total of 1584 patients were included: 60.4% were men, 738 (46.5%) developed AKI, 23.6% were classified as KDIGO 3, and 11.1% had renal replacement therapy. The risk factors for developing AKI during hospitalization were male sex (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.73–2.99), age (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01–1.03), history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (OR 3.61, 95% CI 2.03–6.42), High Blood Pressure (HBP) (OR 6.51, 95% CI 2.10–20.2), higher qSOFA score to the admission (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.14–1.71), the use of vancomycin (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05–2.37), piperacillin/tazobactam (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.2–2.31), and vasopressor support (CI 2.39, 95% CI 1.53–3.74). The gross hospital mortality for AKI was 45.5% versus 11.7% without AKI. Conclusions: This cohort showed that male sex, age, history of HBP and CKD, presentation with elevated qSOFA, in-hospital use of nephrotoxic drugs and the requirement for vasopressor support were the main risk factors for developing AKI in patients hospitalized for COVID-19.",2023,NA,"BMC Nephrology","10.1186/s12882-023-03172-8","#3901",NA,NA,NA,NA,1584,738,NA,NA
"Clinical Features and Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Retrospective Observational Study","Bouguezzi, N.; Ben Saida, I.; Toumi, R.; Meddeb, K.; Ennouri, E.; Bedhiafi, A.; Hamdi, D.; Boussarsar, M.","Background: An alarming number of COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases, have developed acute kidney injury (AKI). Aim: The study aimed to assess the frequency, risk factors, and impact of AKI on mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Methods: The study was a retrospective observational study conducted in the MICU. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for AKI and clinical outcomes. Results: During the study period, 465 consecutive COVID-19 patients were admitted to the MICU. The patients’ characteristics were median age, 64 [54–71] years; median SAPSII, 31 [24–38]; and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 244 (52.5%). The overall ICU mortality rate was 49%. Two hundred twenty-nine (49.2%) patients developed AKI. The factors independently associated with AKI were positive fluid balance (OR, 2.78; 95%CI [1.88–4.11]; p < 0.001), right heart failure (OR, 2.15; 95%CI [1.25–3.67]; p = 0.005), and IMV use (OR, 1.55; 95%CI [1.01–2.40]; p = 0.044). Among the AKI patients, multivariate analysis identified the following factors as independently associated with ICU mortality: age (OR, 1.05; 95%CI [1.02–1.09]; p = 0.012), IMV use (OR, 48.23; 95%CI [18.05–128.89]; p < 0.001), and septic shock (OR, 3.65; 95%CI [1.32–10.10]; p = 0.012). Conclusion: The present study revealed a high proportion of AKI among critically ill COVID-19 patients.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of AKI in Brazilian hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and identify the risk factors associated with its onset and those associated with its prognosis. Methods: A prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a public and tertiary university hospital in São Paulo from March to December 2020. Results: There were 347 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 52.4% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 47.6% were admitted to the wards. The overall incidence of AKI was 46.4%, more frequent in the ICU (68.1% vs 22.4, p < 0.01) and the overall mortality was 36.1%. Acute kidney replacement therapy was indicated in 46.6% of patients with AKI. In the general population, the factors associated with AKI were older age (OR 1.03, CI 1–1.05, p < 0.05), mechanical ventilation (OR 1.23, CI 1.06–1.83, p < 0.05), presence of proteinuria (OR 1.46, CI 1.22–1.93, p < 0.05), and use of vasoactive drugs (OR 1.26, CI 1.07–1.92, p < 0.05).

We aimed to estimate the risk of specific organ dysfunctions and mortality in women and men. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study included 17 hospitals within 5 European countries participating in the International Survey and results of Acute Coronavirus Syndromes COVID-19 (NCT05188612). Participants were individuals hospitalized with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 2020 to February 2022. Risk-adjusted ratios (RRs) of in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute heart failure (AHF), and acute kidney injury (AKI) were calculated for women vs. men. Estimates were evaluated by inverse probability weighting and logistic regression models. The overall care cohort included 4499 patients with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Of these, 1524 (33.9%) were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and 1117 (24.8%) died during hospitalization. Compared with men, women were less likely to be admitted to ICU [RR: 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71–0.91]. In general wards (GWs) and ICU cohorts, the adjusted women-to-men RRs for in-hospital mortality were of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.90–1.42) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70–1.05; pinteraction = 0.04). Development of AHF, AKI, and ARF was associated with increased mortality risk (odds ratios: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.73–2.98; 3.85, 95% CI: 3.21–4.63; and 3.95, 95% CI: 3.04–5.14, respectively). The adjusted RRs for AKI and ARF were comparable among women and men regardless of intensity of care. In contrast, female sex was associated with higher odds for AHF in GW, but not in ICU (RRs: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.94–1.67 vs. 0.83; 95% CI: 0.59–1.16, pinteraction = 0.04). Conclusions Women in GW were at increased risk of AHF and in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 compared with men. For patients receiving ICU care, fatal complications including AHF and mortality appeared to be independent of sex.

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, intensive care unit admission, intubation, and length of hospital stay among Jordanian patients. This was a one-year retrospective study of 745 COVID-19 patients admitted to Jordan University Hospital. Data regarding the patients’ demographics, clinical and co-morbid conditions, imaging, laboratory parameters, mortality, intensive care unit admission (ICU), and intubation were collected from their medical records using a coding manual. The data revealed that the overall rates of COVID-19-related mortality, ICU admission, and invasive intubation were 23.0%, 28.3%, and 10.8%, respectively. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), troponin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and O2 saturation <90% were significantly associated with the mortality rate. The variables that were significantly associated with ICU admission were heart failure and the use of remdesivir. However, O2 saturation <90% and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the only variables associated with invasive intubation.

"Frequency of Diabetes Mellitus and Newly Diagnosed Hyperglycemia and Their Impacts on Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients","Rashidi, H.; Amiri, F.; Abaforush, F.; Mehraban, Z.; Pouladzadeh, M.; Sedaghat, A.","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its associated morbidities are a great global concern. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and high mortality in patients with COVID-19. Objectives: This study examined the frequency of BM, newly diagnosed hyperglycemia, and their impacts on hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective study examined 810 medical records of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Razi Hospital, Ahvaz, Iran. The clinical presentations, severity, and impacts of COVID-19 were compared between patients with and without DM. Disease severity was determined based on the NEWS2 scoring system. Results: This study included 810 medical records of COVID-19 patients, of whom 326 had pre-existing DM, and 484 were non-DM. The rates of diabetes and newly diagnosed hyperglycemia were 40.2% and 11.2%, respectively. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (35.3%), ischemic heart disease (17.9%), and chronic kidney disease (11.9%), which were higher in people with diabetes than non-diabetics. The rate of acute kidney injury was higher in patients with diabetes than in non-diabetics (30.7% vs. 19.2%; P < 0.001) and in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those whose disease was not severe (27.8% vs. 21.5%; P = 0.04).

We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in Catalonia (Spain). Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, drug and medical treatment, physiological and laboratory results, AKI development, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and clinical outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis for AKI development and mortality were used. A total of 1,642 patients were enrolled (mean age 63 (15.95) years, 67.5% male). Mechanical ventilation (MV) was required for 80.8% and 64.4% of these patients, who were in prone position, while 67.7% received vasopressors. AKI at ICU admission was 28.4% and increased to 40.1% during ICU stay. A total of 172 (10.9%) patients required RRT, which represents 27.8% of the patients who developed AKI. AKI was more frequent in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ARDS patients (68% vs 53.6%, p<0.001) and in MV patients (91.9% vs 77.7%, p<0.001), who required the prone position more frequently (74.8 vs 61%, p<0.001) and developed more infections.

"Outcomes of COVID 19 patients with acute kidney injury in Thi Qar province, south of Iraq","Al-Omer, D.K.","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with an increased mortality rate among hospitalized patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is not well described. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients who were referred to Al-Hussein Teaching Hospital in Thi-Qar Governorate, Iraq, from 15 February to 15 May 2020, diagnosed with Corona Varus by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) A test with a diagnosis of COVID.-19. AKI was determined according to the outcome criteria for creatinine determination and Introduced by the KDIGO in 2012. Patients were stratified based on recovery, dialysis, and hospital mortality. We also assessed risk indicators associated with AKI during hospitalization along with in-hospital outcomes, recovery rate, and death at the time of discharge. And after three months of going out for both sexes. Results: We evaluated 2044 patients, whose ages ranged from 18 to more than 65 years, for both males and females, and the percentage of males 54.7% and females 45.3% were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. AKI occurred in 194(8.02%) patients; 55(35.5%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. It was observed that 43.1% of males recovered to 43.8% of the females who were cured inside the hospital, and there was a percentage of patients Those who needed dialysis, and there was a percentage of deaths among males and females. Patients with AKI showed a significantly higher mortality rate. The patients’ condition was followed up after their discharge from the hospital, and the percentage of those who were cured and the patients who needed dialysis was determined, and the rate and mortality. conclusion: We found that male sex, patients' ages, history of chronic kidney disease, and disease severity were independent risk factors associated with AKI in COVID-19 patients. Whereas, acute renal insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of death, increased dialysis patients, and inhospital complications.

"Kinetics of the Cell Cycle Arrest Biomarkers (TIMP2 and IGFBP7) for the Diagnosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients","Greco, M.; De Rosa, S.; Boehm, F.; Spano, S.; Aceto, R.; Voza, A.; Reggiani, F.; Calatroni, M.; Castellani, G.; Costantini, E.; Villa, G.; Cecconi, M.","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly prevalent in critical COVID-19 patients. The diagnosis and staging of AKI are based on serum creatinine (sCr) and urinary output criteria, with limitations in the functional markers. New cell-cycle arrest biomarkers [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] have been proposed for early detection of AKI, but their role in critically ill COVID-19 patients is poorly understood. Methods: We conducted an observational study to assess the performance of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] for the detection of AKI in critical COVID-19 patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). We sampled urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels at ICU admission, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, and compared the results to the development of AKI, as well as baseline and laboratory data. Results: Forty-one patients were enrolled. The median age was 66 years [57–72] and most were males (85%). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed no/mild stage AKI, 19 patients (46.3%) moderate AKI, and nine patients (22.0%) severe AKI. The ICU mortality was 29.3%. sCr levels in the Emergency Department or at ICU admission were not significantly different according to AKI stage.

"Statin therapy may protect against acute kidney injury in patients hospitalized for interstitial SARS-CoV2 pneumonia","Piani, F.; Di Salvo, E.; Landolfo, M.; Saracino, I.M.; Agnoletti, D.; Borghi, C.; Fiorini, G.","Background and aims: COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) represents an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. Chronic statin therapy use is highly prevalent in individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. Our aim is to assess whether patients under treatment with statins have a lower risk of AKI and in-hospital mortality during hospitalization for interstitial SARS-CoV2 pneumonia. Methods and results: Our study is a prospective observational study on 269 consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia at the Internal Medicine Unit of IRCCS Sant'Orsola Hospital in Bologna, Italy. We compared the clinical characteristics between patients receiving statin therapy (n = 65) and patients not treated with statins and we assessed if chronic statin use was associated with a reduced risk for AKI, all-cause mortality, admission to ICU, and disease severity. Statin use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing AKI (OR 0.47, IC 0.23 to 0.95, p 0.036) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, statin use was associated with reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p 0.048) at hospital admission. No significant impact in risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.98, IC 0.71 to 5.50, p 0.191) and ICU admission (HR 0.93, IC 0.52 to 1.65, p 0.801) was observed with statin use, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and CKD.

The short and long-term outcomes of patients who develop AKI have not been well characterized. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of critically ill adults with severe COVID-19 and AKI. Patient-level variables were extracted from the electronic medical record. Using nadir-to-peak serum creatinine, AKI was defined using the KDIGO definition. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined factors associated with development of moderate-to-severe (stage 2-3) AKI, severe (stage-3) AKI, and the composite of renal replacement therapy (RRT) or in-hospital death. Results: Among 459 critically ill adults with COVID-19, 371 (80.1%) developed AKI, with 179 (37.9%) developing stage-3 AKI. Male gender, black and Asian/Native American race, lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), higher body mass index (BMI), and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score were more prevalent among patients with severe AKI, as were systemic markers of inflammation. On multivariable analysis, male gender, black and Asian/Native American race, higher APACHE IV score, lower baseline eGFR, and higher BMI (mainly the highest BMI stratum ≥35 kg/m2) were independently associated with higher stages of AKI severity. Male gender, lower baseline eGFR, and higher APACHE IV score were also independently associated with the composite of RRT or in-hospital death. Moderate-to-severe AKI and severe AKI were independently associated with in-hospital death, and there was a significant interaction between BMI and moderate-to-severe AKI for the outcome of in-hospital death. Among 83 (18.1%) patients who required RRT, 27 (32.5%) survived, and 12 (44.4%) remained dialysis-dependent at discharge. At 3 and 6 months, 5 (41.7%) and 4 (33.3%) remained dialysis-dependent, respectively. Conclusions: AKI is common in critically ill adults with COVID-19. Several patient-level risk factors are associated with higher stages of AKI severity. BMI might be an effect modifier of AKI severity for in-hospital death.

Sixty patients had minimal lung damage (< 25%), 105 patients had mild lung damage (25–50%), 186 had severe lung damage (50–75%) and 193 patients had very severe lung damage (> 75%). A total of 210 patients (35%) developed AKI, of whom 78 (37.2%) had mild AKI (stage 1) and 132 (62.8%) severe AKI (stages 2 and 3). Patients in the severe and mild AKI groups had a higher rate of comorbidities, especially hypertension (mild AKI [46.2%] vs. severe AKI [36.4%] vs. no AKI [27.4%], p = 0.002) and diabetes (mild AKI [52.6%] vs. severe AKI [33.3%] vs. no AKI [26.4%], p < 0.001). During hospitalization, 23.3% of patients with AKI received kidney replacement therapy. In-hospital mortality was observed in 51.3% for mild AKI, 55.3% for severe AKI and 21% in patients who did not have AKI (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings revealed that not only severe AKI, but also mild AKI was correlated to in-hospital mortality.

"Early reduction of estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) predicts poor outcome in acutely ill hospitalized COVID-19 patients firstly admitted to medical regular wards (eGFR-COV19 study)","Cei, F.; Chiarugi, L.; Brancati, S.; Montini, M.S.; Dolenti, S.; Di Stefano, D.; Beatrice, S.; Sellerio, I.; Messiniti, V.; Gucci, M.M.; Vannini, G.; Lavecchia, R.; Cioni, E.; Mattaliano, C.; Pelagalli, G.; Panigada, G.; Murgo, E.; Mazzoccoli, G.; Landini, G.; Tarquini, R.","Background: Analysis of autopsy tissues obtained from patients who died from COVID-19 showed kidney tropism for SARS-COV-2, with COVID-19-related renal dysfunction representing an overlooked problem even in patients lacking previous history of chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to corroborate in a substantial sample of consecutive acutely ill COVID-19 hospitalized patients the efficacy of estimated GFR (eGFR), assessed at hospital admission, to identify acute renal function derangement and the predictive role of its association with in-hospital death and need for mechanical ventilation and admission to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed charts of 764 patients firstly admitted to regular medical wards (Division of Internal Medicine) for symptomatic COVID-19 between March 6th and May 30th, 2020 and between October 1st, 2020 and March 15th, 2021. eGFR values were calculated with the 2021 CKD-EPI formula and assessed at hospital admission and discharge. Baseline creatinine and GFR values were assessed by chart review of patients’ medical records from hospital admittance data in the previous year. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, while ARDS development and need for non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) were the secondary outcomes. Results: SARS-COV-2 infection was diagnosed in 764 patients admitted with COVID-19 symptoms. A total of 682 patients (age range 23–100 years) were considered for statistical analysis, 310 needed mechanical ventilation and 137 died. An eGFR value <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was found in 208 patients, 181 met KDIGO AKI criteria; eGFR values at hospital admission were significantly lower with respect to both hospital discharge and baseline values (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, an eGFR value <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (OR 2.6, 1.7–4.8, p = 0.003); no association was found with both ARDS and need for mechanical ventilation. eGFR was non-inferior to both IL-6 serum levels and CALL Score in predicting in-hospital death (AUC 0.71, 0.68–0.74, p = 0.55). Conclusions: eGFR calculated at hospital admission correlated well with COVID-19-related kidney injury and eGFR values < 60 mL/min/1,73 m2 were independently associated with in-hospital mortality, but not with both ARDS or need for mechanical ventilation.",2022,NA,"Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy","10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113454","#4453",NA,NA,NA,NA,764,181,NA,NA

The exacerbation of the immune response seems to contribute to AKI development, but the immunopathological process is not completely understood. Objectives: To analyze levels of circulant immune mediators in COVID-19 patients evolving with or without AKI. We have also investigated possible associations of these mediators with viral load and clinical outcomes. Methods: This is a longitudinal study performed with hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Serum levels of 27 immune mediators were measured by a multiplex immunoassay. Data were analyzed at two timepoints during the follow-up: within the first 13 days of the disease onset (early sample) and from the 14th day to death or hospital discharge (follow-up sample). Results: We studied 82 COVID-19 patients (59.5 ± 17.5 years, 54.9% male). Of these, 34 (41.5%) developed AKI. These patients presented higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load (P = 0.03), higher frequency of diabetes (P = 0.01) and death (P = 0.0004). Overall, AKI patients presented significantly higher and sustained levels (P < 0.05) of CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-4, CXCL-8, CXCL-10, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1Ra, IL-10 and VEGF. Importantly, higher levels of CCL-2, CXCL-10, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-10, FGFb, and VEGF were observed in AKI patients independently of death. ROC curves demonstrated that early alterations in CCL-2, CXCL-8, CXCL-10, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1Ra and IL-10 show a good predictive value regarding AKI development. Lastly, immune mediators were significantly associated with each other and with SARS-CoV-2 viral load in AKI patients.

"Association between the Use of Antibiotics and the Development of Acute Renal Injury in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 in a Hospital in the Peruvian Amazon","Romaní, L.; León-Figueroa, D.A.; Rafael-Navarro, D.; Barboza, J.J.; Rodriguez-Morales, A.J.","Introduction: A significant antibiotic prescribing pattern associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been described. Multiple protocols included empirical antimicrobials, leading to a substantial increase in antimicrobial consumption in medical care. A higher mortality rate is described among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received antibiotics. Objectives: To determine the association between the use of antibiotics and the development of acute renal injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated at the Hospital II EsSalud de Ucayali, 2021. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted, evaluating the medical records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit between July 2020 and July 2021. For the statistical analysis, measures of central tendency and dispersion, statistical hypothesis contrast tests were used in relation to acute kidney injury (AKI), antibiotic use and associated factors, derived from linear regression models. Results: The factors that were positively associated with the development of AKI were sepsis (aPR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.26–6.43), shock (aPR:2.49; 95% CI: 1.28–4.86), mechanical ventilation (aPR:9.11; 95% CI: 1.23–67.57), and use of vancomycin (aPR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.19–8.27). Conclusions: In the Peruvian Amazon, there is a high consumption and inadequate prescription of antibiotics. The drugs most commonly used for the treatment of COVID-19 were: aminoglycosides, vancomycin, ivermectin, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and corticosteroids. The development of AKI among hospitalized patients was found to be related to vancomycin administration. In addition, an association was found with the use of mechanical ventilation, a high body mass index, and the presence of complications such as sepsis or shock. Therefore, inappropriate antibiotic use for COVID-19 has been associated with multiple negative outcomes and consequences.",2022,NA,"Journal of Clinical Medicine","10.3390/jcm11154493","#4488",NA,NA,NA,NA,0,0,NA,NA
"A Prospective Study on Risk Factors for Acute Kidney Injury and All-Cause Mortality in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients From Tehran (Iran)","Rostami, Z.; Mastrangelo, G.; Einollahi, B.; Nemati, E.; Shafiee, S.; Ebrahimi, M.; Javanbakht, M.; Saadat, S.H.; Amini, M.; Einollahi, Z.; Beyram, B.; Cegolon, L.","Background: Several reports suggested that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a relatively common occurrence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but its prevalence is inconsistently reported across different populations. Moreover, it is unknown whether AKI results from a direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 or it is a consequence of the physiologic disturbances and therapies used to treat COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of AKI since it varies by geographical settings, time periods, and populations studied and to investigate whether clinical information and laboratory findings collected at hospital admission might influence AKI incidence (and mortality) in a particular point in time during hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods: Herein we conducted a prospective longitudinal study investigating the prevalence of AKI and associated factors in 997 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Baqiyatallah general hospital of Tehran (Iran), collecting both clinical information and several dates (of: birth; hospital admission; AKI onset; ICU admission; hospital discharge; death). In order to examine how the clinical factors influenced AKI incidence and all-cause mortality during hospitalization, survival analysis using the Cox proportional-hazard models was adopted. Two separate multiple Cox regression models were fitted for each outcome (AKI and death). Results: In this group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of AKI was 28.5% and the mortality rate was 19.3%. AKI incidence was significantly enhanced by diabetes, hyperkalemia, higher levels of WBC count, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). COVID-19 patients more likely to die over the course of their hospitalization were those presenting a joint association between ICU admission with either severe COVID-19 or even mild/moderate COVID-19, hypokalemia, and higher levels of BUN, WBC, and LDH measured at hospital admission. Diabetes and comorbidities did not increase the mortality risk among these hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Since the majority of patients developed AKI after ICU referral and 40% of them were admitted to ICU within 2 days since hospital admission, these patients may have been already in critical clinical conditions at admission, despite being affected by a mild/moderate form of COVID-19, suggesting the need of early monitoring of these patients for the onset of eventual systemic complications.",2022,NA,"Frontiers in Immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2022.874426","#4503",NA,NA,NA,NA,997,283,NA,NA

Therefore, we analyzed the correlation of AKI risk factors, ventilatory support, and renal replacement therapy and compared the outcomes of first and second COVID-19 waves in this tertiary care center. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the patients' medical records with a positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 between July 2020 and May 2021. We looked at the clinical outcomes of the first and second COVID-19 waves and documented the frequency, risk factors for AKI, and the relationship between AKI and in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression yielded odds ratios for the risk variables of AKI. Risk differences and age-adjusted odds ratios, as well as 99.5% confidence intervals, were used to compare COVID-19 outcomes between the first and second waves. Results: Of the 1260 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, 86 (6.8%) presented with AKI and 8 (0.7%) patients required dialysis. The most common comorbidity was diabetes mellitus (55.2%), hypertension (42.1%), hypothyroidism (11.3%), and coronary artery disease (8.1%). A total of 229 (18.17%) patients were admitted to ICU, 574 (45.5%) received ventilation, and 26 (2.0%) required mechanical ventilation. The incidence of in-hospital death in the patients with AKI as per the stage from 1 to 3 was 9 (15.8%), 7 (35%), and 5 (55.6%), respectively.

We investigated the values of procalcitonin (PCT) and presepsin (PSS) for predicting AKI and 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 151 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital via the emergency department. The diagnosis of AKI was based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guidelines. Results: The median patient age was 77 years, and 86 patients (57%) were male.

"Cystatin C is a marker for acute kidney injury, but not for mortality among COVID-19 patients in Mexico","Ramos-Santos, K.; Cortes-Telles, A.; Uc-Miam, M.E.; Avila-Nava, A.; Lugo, R.; Aké, R.C.; Gutiérrez-Solis, A.L.","Background: Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 can develop acute kidney injury (AKI), associated with adverse clinical outcomes. In Mexico, an AKI incidence of 60.7% was reported in patients with COVID-19. Serum cystatin C is a well-known marker for AKI. It has been postulated as a marker for mortality in Chinese patients with COVID-19. Information regarding levels of cystatin C in COVID-19-infected patients is nonexistent among Mexican or Latin American populations. Aim: This work aimed to assess the level of cystatin C as an indicator of AKI and mortality among COVID-19 patients from Mexico. Methods: A cross-sectional study among 38 adults was performed in the Regional High Specialty Hospital of the Yucatan Peninsula in Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Baseline characteristics and clinical and biomechanical parameters were collected, and serum levels of cystatin C were measured by ELISA. Results: A total of 71% (27 patients) with COVID-19 developed AKI; 78% were men, and 22% were women. In addition, 60% of individuals (16 men; 7 women) died due to COVID-19 complications. Serum levels of cystatin C were higher in those individuals who developed AKI (p = 0.001). A logistic regression model indicated that individuals with serum levels of cystatin C above 0.84 ng/mL had a 23-fold increased risk of developing AKI (OR, 23.7, 95% CI, 2.59-217.00, p = 0.005). However, increased cystatin C was not independently associated with mortality in the Mexican population (HR, 1.01, 95% CI, 0.66-1.56, p = 0.959). Conclusion: The results suggest that serum levels of cystatin C indicate AKI in COVID-19 patients. Although we recommend caution when using serum cystatin C levels as an indicator of mortality among the Mexican population, it is essential to note that cystatin C elevates earlier than creatinine, which is an advantage for timely clinical interventions.",2022,NA,"Brazilian Journal of Infectious Diseases","10.1016/j.bjid.2022.102365","#4641",NA,NA,NA,NA,38,27,NA,NA

Urinary proteinuria profile could be a non-invasive tool of interest to scrutinize the pathophysiological process underlying AKI in COVID-19 patients. Material and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study between March 2020 and April 2020. All patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and without end-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapy before ICU admission were included. Our objectives were to assess the incidence and risk factors for AKI and to describe its clinical and biological characteristics, particularly its urinary protein profile. Results: Seventy patients were included; 87% needed mechanical ventilation and 61% needed vasopressor during their ICU stay; 64.3% of patients developed AKI and half of them needed dialysis. Total and tubular proteinuria on day 1 were higher in patients with AKI, whereas glomerular proteinuria was similar in both groups.

"Early prediction of COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury: Are serum NGAL and serum Cystatin C levels better than serum creatinine?","Pode Shakked, N.; de Oliveira, M.H.S.; Cheruiyot, I.; Benoit, J.L.; Plebani, M.; Lippi, G.; Benoit, S.W.; Henry, B.M.","Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), often requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Serum Cystatin C (sCysC) and serum Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (sNGAL) are emerging biomarkers for kidney injury, and were suggested to be superior to serum creatinine (sCr) in several clinical settings. Moreover, elevated sCysC is associated with disease severity and mortality in COVID-19. We aimed to assess the utility of sCysC and sNGAL for predicting COVID-19-associated AKI, need for RRT, and need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission, when measured at presentation to the emergency department (ED). Methods: Patients presenting to the ED with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome was development of COVID-19-associated AKI, while the secondary outcomes were need for RRT and ICU admission. Results: Among 52 COVID-19 patients, 22 (42.3%) developed AKI with 8/22 (36.4%) requiring RRT. Both sCr and sCysC demonstrated excellent performance for predicting AKI (AUC, 0.86 and 0.87, respectively) and need for RRT (AUC, 0.94 and 0.95, respectively). sNGAL displayed acceptable performance for predicting AKI (AUC, 0.81) and need for RRT (AUC, 0.87). Conclusions: SCr and sCysC measured at ED presentation are both highly accurate predictors of AKI and need for RRT, whereas sNGAL demonstrated adequate diagnostic performance. While sCyC was previously shown to be superior to sCr as a diagnostic biomarker of kidney injury in certain etiologies, our findings demonstrate that sCr is comparable to sCyC in the context of predicting COVID-19-associated AKI. Given the high sensitivity of these biomarkers for predicting the need for RRT, and as sCysC is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients, we recommend their measurement for enabling risk stratification and early intervention.",2022,NA,"Clinical Biochemistry","10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2022.01.006","#4675",NA,NA,NA,NA,52,22,NA,NA

One-hundred and sixtytwo intensive care unit (ICU) admitted patients in a tertiary level hospital in the city of Buenos Aires with COVID-19 diagnosis were included. We hypothesized that COVID-19 related AKI would develop in the period of more severe hypoxemia as an early event and late AKI would be more probably related to intensive care unit complications. For this purpose, we divided subjects into two groups: those with early AKI and late AKI, before and after day 14 from symptom onset, respectively. A stepwise multivariate analysis was conducted to find possible AKI predictors. AKI incidence was 43.2% (n = 70) of the total patients admitted into ICU with severe COVID-19, 11.1% (n = 18) required renal replacement therapy. In-hospital mortality was higher (58.6%) for the AKI group. AKI occurred on a median time of 10 (IQR 5.5-17.5) days from symptom onset. A history of hypertension or heart failure, age and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) requirement were identified as risk factors. Late AKI (n = 25, 35.7%) was associated with sepsis and nephrotoxic exposure, whereas early AKI occurred closer to the timing of IMV initiation and was more likely to have an unknown origin.

"Age, Comorbid Conditions, and Racial Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes","Wiley, Z.; Kubes, J.N.; Cobb, J.; Jacob, J.T.; Franks, N.; Plantinga, L.; Lea, J.","BACKGROUND: Black patients are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to compare risks of hospitalization of Black and non-Black COVID-19 patients presenting to the emergency department and, of those hospitalized, to compare mortality and acute kidney injury. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 831 adult COVID-19 patients (68.5% Black) who presented to the emergency departments of four academic hospitals, March 1, 2020-May 31, 2020. The primary outcome was risk of hospitalization among Blacks vs. non-Blacks. Secondary outcomes were mortality and acute kidney injury, among hospitalized patients. RESULTS: The crude odds of hospitalization were not different in Black vs. non-Black patients; however, with adjustment for age, Blacks had 55% higher odds of hospitalization. Mortality differed most in the model adjusted for age alone. Acute kidney injury was more common in the Black hospitalized patients, regardless of adjustment. Stratified analyses suggested that disparities in the risk of hospitalization and of in-hospital acute kidney injury were highest in the youngest patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our report shows that Black and non-Black patients presenting to the emergency department with COVID-19 had similar risks of hospitalization and, of those who were hospitalized, similar mortality when adjusted for multiple factors. Blacks had higher risk of acute kidney injury. Our results suggest that examination of disparities without exploration of the individual effects of age and comorbidities may mask important patterns. While stratified analyses suggest that disparities in outcomes may differ substantially by age and comorbid conditions, further exploration among these important subgroups is needed to better target interventions to reduce disparities in COVID-19 clinical outcomes.",2022,NA,"Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities","10.1007/s40615-020-00934-0","#4782",NA,NA,NA,NA,831,0,NA,NA
"Acute Kidney Injury Incidence, Stage, and Recovery in Patients with COVID-19","Bandelac, L.; Shah, K.D.; Purmessur, P.; Ghazanfar, H.; Nasr, R.","Purpose: To determine the incidence, mortality, stage, and recovery of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients and further analyze the effect of patient demographics and comorbidities on AKI incidence. Study Design: Our study looked at 1545 charts of patients over 18 years old who presented to BronxCare Hospital in NY with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Using the KDIGO criteria, any patient presenting with a creatinine of 1.5 times the baseline or that had an increase in creatinine of 0.3mg/dL in 48 hours was diagnosed with AKI. Pregnant patients, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and patients with a history of renal transplant were excluded. Results: The incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 39% (608), and the mortality rate was 58.2% (354). Of the 254 survivors, 74.8% recovered. Moreover, 42.6% (259) of patients with AKI were admitted to the ICU. Twenty-six of our patients received hemodialysis during admission. There was a statistically significant association between AKI and age, race, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), hepatitis C (HCV), congestive heart failure (CHF), CKD, patient outcome, and days spent in the hospital. Of the 608 patients with AKI, 294 (48.4%), 185 (30.4%) and 129 (21.2%) had AKI stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Conclusion: Early resource planning is necessary when admitting COVID-19 patients. Nephrology should be consulted early, and measures should be in place to optimize outpatient follow-up in the nephrology clinic. Lastly, the use of nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered and, if possible, avoided from the time of admission in patients with COVID-19.",2022,NA,"International Journal of Nephrology and Renovascular Disease","10.2147/IJNRD.S352600","#4818",NA,NA,NA,NA,1545,608,NA,NA
"Acute Kidney Injury Outcome in COVID-19 Patients","Sabaghian, T.; Koomleh, A.A.; Nassiri, A.A.; Kharazmi, A.B.; Khalili, S.","Introduction. Despite the high incidence of AKI in patients with COVID-19, the characteristics and consequences of this condition have not been well studied. Methods. This retrospective cohort study investigated the clinical characteristics, treatment methods, and outcome of COVID-19 patients aged 18 years and older who were hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, from February 20th, 2020 to June 20th, 2020. Results. Out of the total 367 patients with COVID-19, 104 (28%) patients were diagnosed with AKI at the time of admission or during hospitalization, 86 (23%) and 18 (5%) patients were diagnosed with the AKI on admission (early AKI) and after the first 24 h (late AKI), respectively. Concerning the AKI stages, 20 (19%) and 18 (17%) patients were in stages 2 and 3, and the cause of AKI in 52 (50%) patients was renal. Moreover, out of all patients with AKI, 25 (24%) and 29 (28%) patients had transient (Kidney function improvement within 48 h) and persistent AKI (kidney function improvement between 48 h to 7 days). Furthermore, 32 (31%) patients developed acute kidney damage (AKD) (no improvement in AKI after 7 days). The survival rate of AKI patients was lower in higher stages of AKI, and in cases that the reason for kidney dysfunction was renal or unknown. However, there was no difference in the mortality rate between the early and late AKI. Conclusion. Since about one-third of the patients with AKI eventually develop AKD, it is of great importance to closely monitor all COVID-19 patients, especially the high-risk ones, for the appropriate diagnosis and treatment of AKI.",2022,NA,"Iranian Journal of Kidney Diseases","10.52547/ijkd.6610","#4822",NA,NA,NA,NA,367,104,NA,NA
"Prevalence of Acute Kidney Injury in Covid-19 Patients-Retrospective Single-Center Study","Bashir, A.M.; Mukhtar, M.S.; Cetinkaya, O.; Fiidow, O.A.; Mohamed, Y.G.","Introduction: In December 2019, a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and spread rapidly to other regions of the world. Although diffuse alveolar injury and acute respiratory failure were the most prominent characteristics, further investigation of organ involvement is essential. Aim: In this study, we aim to determine the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in covid-19 patients and also the relationship between inflammatory markers, the severity of lung involvement, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 102 COVID-19 patients presented to a tertiary teaching hospital in Mogadishu during the second wave of Covid-19 2021. Patients’ age, gender, comorbidities, hemoglobin, platelet, and white blood cell counts, glucose, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, CRP, ferritin, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) Covid-19 test and CT scan findings were all collected. Results: The mean age of the patients was 58 (Range 23–91 years), including 64 men and 38 women. The prevalence of acute kidney injury was 12.7%. There was a significant association between acute kidney injury, CRP and ferritin with the p values of P<0.003 and P<0.004, respectively. For severity of lung involvement with computed tomography finding, 35 (34.3%) had mild, 35 (34.3%) had moderate and 32 (31.4%) had severe lung involvement. There was significant association between the lung involvement, Ferritin and CRP levels with P values of P<0.005 and P<0.007 respectively. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that acute kidney injury is common in covid-19 patients and can increase the morbidity and mortality of these patients. As a result, clinicians in low-resource countries such as Somalia should be more vigilant about kidney injury in patients with severe COVID-19.",2022,NA,"Infection and Drug Resistance","10.2147/IDR.S357997","#4833",NA,NA,NA,NA,102,12,NA,58
"Procalcitonin and High APACHE (Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation) Level Are Associated with the Course of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients with SARS-CoV-2","Andrade Sierra, J.; Delgado Astorga, C.; Nava Vargas, M.G.; Rojas Campos, E.; Arrelano Arteaga, K.J.; Hernández Morales, K.; Andrade Castellanos, C.A.; Andrade-Ortega, A.D.J.; González Correa, L.G.","Background. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with poor outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Sepsis, direct injury to kidney cells by the virus, and severe systemic inflammation are mechanisms implicated in its development. We investigated the association between inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin) in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the development of AKI. Methods. A prospective cohort study performed at the Civil Hospital (Dr. Juan I. Menchaca) Guadalajara, Mexico, included patients aged >18 years with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR and who did or did not present with AKI (KDIGO) while hospitalized. Biomarkers of inflammation were recorded, and kidney function was estimated using the CKD-EPI formula. Results. 291 patients were included (68% males; average age, 57 years). The incidence of AKI was 40.5% (118 patients); 21% developed stage 1 AKI, 6% developed stage 2 AKI, and 14% developed stage 3 AKI. The development of AKI was associated with higher phosphate (p=0.002) (RR 1.39, CI 95% 1.13-1.72), high procalcitonin levels at hospital admission (p=0.005) (RR 2.09, CI 95% 1.26-3.50), and high APACHE scores (p=0.011) (RR 2.0, CI 95% 1.17-3.40). The survival analysis free of AKI according to procalcitonin levels and APACHE scores demonstrated a lower survival in patients with procalcitonin >0.5 ng/ml (p=0.001) and APACHE >15 points (p=0.004).

"Renal resistive index is associated with acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients treated in the intensive care unit","Renberg, M.; Jonmarker, O.; Kilhamn, N.; Rimes-Stigare, C.; Bell, M.; Hertzberg, D.","Background: Renal resistive index (RRI) is a promising tool for the assessment of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients in general, but its role and association to AKI among patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not known. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the pattern of RRI in relation to AKI in patients with COVID-19 treated in the intensive care unit. Methods: In this observational cohort study, RRI was measured in COVID-19 patients in six intensive care units at two sites of a Swedish University Hospital. AKI was defined by the creatinine criteria in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes classification. We investigated the association between RRI and AKI diagnosis, different AKI stages and urine output. Results: RRI was measured in 51 patients, of which 23 patients (45%) had AKI at the time of measurement. Median RRI in patients with AKI was 0.80 (IQR 0.71–0.85) compared to 0.72 (IQR 0.67–0.78) in patients without AKI (p = 0.004). Compared to patients without AKI, RRI was higher in patients with AKI stage 3 (median 0.83, IQR 0.71–0.85, p = 0.006) but not in patients with AKI stage 1 (median 0.76, IQR 0.71–0.83, p = 0.347) or AKI stage 2 (median 0.79, min/max 0.79/0.80, n = 2, p = 0.134). RRI was higher in patients with an ongoing AKI episode compared to patients who never developed AKI (median 0.72, IQR 0.69–0.78, p = 0.015) or patients who developed AKI but had recovered at the time of measurement (median 0.68, IQR 0.67–0.81, p = 0.021). Oliguric patients had higher RRI (median 0.84, IQR 0.83–0.85) compared to non-oliguric patients (median 0.74, IQR 0.69–0.81) (p = 0.009). After multivariable adjustment, RRI was independently associated with AKI (OR for 0.01 increments of RRI 1.22, 95% CI 1.07–1.41).

We aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors for development of AKI, its subsequent clinical course and AKI progression, as well as renal recovery or dialysis dependence and survival in this group of patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in an expanded tertiary care intensive care unit in London, United Kingdom. Critically ill patients admitted to ICU between 1st March 2020 and 31st July 2020 with confirmed SARS-COV2 infection were included. Analysis of baseline characteristics, organ support, COVID-19 associated therapies and their association with mortality and outcomes at 90 days was performed. Results: Of 313 patients (70% male, mean age 54.5 ± 13.9 years), 240 (76.7%) developed AKI within 14 days after ICU admission: 63 (20.1%) stage 1, 41 (13.1%) stage 2, 136 (43.5%) stage 3. 113 (36.1%) patients presented with AKI on ICU admission. Progression to AKI stage 2/3 occurred in 36%. Risk factors for AKI progression were mechanical ventilation [HR (hazard ratio) 4.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61–10.49] and positive fluid balance [HR 1.21 (95% CI 1.11–1.31)], while steroid therapy was associated with a reduction in AKI progression (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.55–0.97]). Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was initiated in 31.9%. AKI patients had a higher 90-day mortality than non-AKI patients (34% vs. 14%; p < 0.001). Dialysis dependence was 5% at hospital discharge and 4% at 90 days. Renal recovery was identified in 81.6% of survivors at discharge and in 90.9% at 90 days. At 3 months, 16% of all AKI survivors had chronic kidney disease (CKD); among those without renal recovery, the CKD incidence was 44%. Conclusions: During the first COVID-19 wave, AKI was highly prevalent among severely ill COVID-19 patients with a third progressing to severe AKI requiring KRT. The risk of developing CKD was high. This study identifies factors modifying AKI progression, including a potentially protective effect of steroid therapy.

Mortality and case-fatality rates vary widely depending on incidence of COVID-19 and the testing policy in affected countries. To date, data comparing hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and influenza is scarce. Methods: Data from patients with COVID-19 were compared to patients infected with influenza A (InfA) and B (InfB) virus during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 seasons. All patients were ≥ 18 years old, had PCR-confirmed infection and needed hospital treatment. Demographic data, medical history, length-of-stay (LOS), complications including in-hospital mortality were analyzed. Results: In total, 142 patients with COVID-19 were compared to 266 patients with InfA and 300 with InfB. Differences in median age (COVID-19 70.5 years vs InfA 70 years and InfB 77 years, p < 0.001) and laboratory results were observed. COVID-19 patients had fewer comorbidities, but complications (respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, acute heart failure and death) occurred more frequently. Median length-of-stay (LOS) was longer in COVID-19 patients (12 days vs InfA 7 days vs. InfB 7 days, p < 0.001). There was a fourfold higher in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients (23.2%) when compared with InfA (5.6%) or InfB (4.7%; p < 0.001). Conclusion: In hospitalized patients, COVID-19 is associated with longer LOS, a higher number of complications and higher in-hospital mortality compared to influenza, even in a population with fewer co-morbidities.

The aim is to evaluate the rate of AKI, defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome guidelines, in a series of critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of a single tertiary teaching hospital. Methods: From April to May 2020, all consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU who did not meet exclusion criteria (length of ICU stay <48 h, ESRD requiring dialysis, and patients still hospitalized in ICU at the time of data analysis) were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified according to the highest AKI stage attained during ICU stay. Results: Sixty-one patients were included in the analysis. AKI was observed in 35/61 patients (57.4%): 25/35 episodes (71.4%) were observed within the first 7 days. AKI was classified as follows: 17.1% stage 1, 25.7% stage 2, and 57.2% stage 3. Fourteen out of 20 stage-3 patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), mostly related to persistent oliguria.

"Manifestations of renal system involvement in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia","Allemailem, K.S.; Almatroudi, A.; Khan, A.A.; Rahmani, A.H.; Almarshad, I.S.; Alekezem, F.S.; Hassanein, N.; El-Kady, A.M.","Background: Although COVID-19 is an acute disease that usually resolves rapidly in most cases, the disease can be fatal and has a mortality rate of about 1% to 56%. Alveolar injury and respiratory failure are the main causes of death in patients with COVID 19. In addition, the effect of the disease on other organs is not fully understood. Renal system affection has been reported in patients with COVID 19 and is associated with a higher rate of diverse outcomes, including mortality. Therefore, in the present work, we reported the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and analyzed the manifestations that indicated renal system involvement and their impact on clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: This was an observational retrospective study conducted at King Fahd Specialist Hospital, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia. All patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to this Hospital from April to December 2020 were included in the study. The patients' findings at presentation were recorded. Demographic data and laboratory results (hematuria, proteinuria, urinary sediment cast and pus cell presence, and kidney function tests) were retrieved from electronic patient records. Results: One hundred and ninety-three patients with confirmed COVID 19 were included in the study. Dipstick examinations of all urine samples showed proteinuria and hematuria in 53.9% and 22.3% of patients, respectively, whereas microscopic examination revealed the presence of pus and brown muddy granular casts in 33.7% and 12.4% of samples, respectively. Acute kidney injury was reported in 23.3% of patients. A multivariable analysis demonstrated that hematuria was associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9; P = 0.001), ICU admission (OR, 3.789; 95% CI, 1.913-7.505; P = 0.003), and mortality (OR, 8.084; 95% CI, 3.756-17.397; P = 0.002). Conversely, proteinuria was less significantly associated with the risk of AKI (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.91-7.50; P = 0.003), ICU admission (OR, 2.493; 95% CI, 1.25-4.72; P = 0.001), and mortality (OR, 2.764; 95% CI, 1.368-5.121; P = 0.003). Patients with AKI had a higher probability for mortality than did those without AKI (OR, 14.208; 95% CI, 6.434-31.375; P = 0.003). Conclusion: The manifestations of the involvement of the renal system are not uncommon in COVID-19. These manifestations included proteinuria, hematuria, and AKI and were usually associated with a poor prognosis, including high incidences of both ICU admission and mortality.",2021,NA,"PLoS ONE","10.1371/journal.pone.0253036","#5236",NA,NA,NA,NA,193,45,NA,NA
"Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: A single-center experience in Nigeria","Ibrahim, O.R.; Oloyede, T.; Gbadamosi, H.; Musa, Y.; Aliu, R.; Bello, S.O.; Alao, M.A.; Suleiman, B.M.; Adedoyin, O.T.","Background & objective: Despite available data from developed countries, suggesting a high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is scarce data from African countries, including Nigeria. We conducted this study to determine and document the incidence, the associated factors and the outcome (in-hospital mortality) of AKI among COVID-19 patients managed in a center in Nigeria. Methodology: It was a retrospective review of confirmed COVID-19 cases managed at a center in Nigeria. AKI was defined using 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria. We extracted relevant data from the electronic records of the COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital and analyzed. Fischer's exact tests were used to test factors associated with AKI for discrete variables, Mann-Whitney U test was used for skewed continuous data, and T-test for continuous normal distribution variables. Results: This study involved 41 of the 56 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The mean age was 45 ± 17.94 y. A majority of the patients were males (33; 80.5%). AKI occurred in 6 (14.6%) of the patients. Of the 6 AKI; 4 (66.7%) and 2 (33.3%) were in stages 1 and 3 respectively. One patient (16.7%) had had hemodialysis. Of the 6 with AKI, 3 died with a mortality rate of 50.0%. Factors associated with AKI included age above 45 years, body weakness, severe and critical COVID, urea > 10 mmol/l, and serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl. Only severe and critical disease was predictive of AKI (adjusted odds ratio 1.777, 95% CI 1.028, 3.074). Conclusion: The results of our study show that AKI is common in severe and critical COVID-19 and is associated with a poor outcome.",2021,NA,"Anaesthesia, Pain and Intensive Care","10.35975/apic.v25i4.1567","#5240",NA,NA,NA,NA,41,6,NA,45
