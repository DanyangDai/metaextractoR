"eGFRcystatinC/eGFRcreatinine ratio < 0.6 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: a prospective cohort study","Avotins, L.; Kroica, J.; Petersons, A.; Zentina, D.; Kravale, Z.; Saulite, A.; Racenis, K.","Background: Shrunken Pore Syndrome (SPS), defined as a reduced ratio between two estimated filtration rates (based on cystatin C and creatinine) is an increasingly recognized risk factor for long-term mortality. Although some patients with other conditions might be erroneously identified as SPS. Our aim was to bring the focus on possible pathophysiologic mechanisms influencing the ratio in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and acute kidney injury. Methods: A single-centered prospective cohort study was conducted to investigate biomarkers in symptomatic COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to a hospital in Latvia. Nineteen biomarkers were measured in blood and three in urine samples. Associations were sought between these biomarkers, chronic diseases and the estimated GFRcystatinC/eGFRcreatinine ratio < 0.6, mortality rates, and acute kidney injury development. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics, with significance set at p < 0.05. Results: We included 59 patients (average age 65.5 years, 45.8% female) admitted with COVID-19. Acute kidney injury occurred in 27.1%, and 25.4% died. Ratio < 0.6 was seen in 38.6%, associated with female sex, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and higher age. Ratio < 0.6 group had mortality notably higher − 40.9% vs. 16.2% and more cases of acute kidney injury (40.9% vs. 18.9%). Cystatin C showed strong associations with the ratio < 0.6 compared to creatinine. Urea levels and urea/creatinine ratio were higher in the ratio < 0.6 group. After excluding acute kidney injury patients, ratio < 0.6 remained associated with higher cystatin C and urea levels. Other biomarkers linked to a kidney injury as NGAL, and proteinuria did not differ. Conclusion: We prove that reduced ratio is common in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and is associated with increased mortality during hospitalization. Factors that influence this ratio are complex and, in addition to the possible shrinkage of pores, other conditions such as thickening of glomerular basal membrane, comorbidities, prerenal kidney failure and others may play an important role and should be addressed when diagnosing SPS. We highlight the need for additional diagnostic criteria for SPS and larger studies to better understand its implications in acute COVID-19 settings.",2023,NA,"BMC Nephrology","10.1186/s12882-023-03315-x","#3910",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without antiviral medications: A retrospective study","Movahed, S.M.M.; Akhavizadegan, H.; Dolatkhani, F.; Akbarpour, S.; Nejadghaderi, S.A.; Najafi, M.; Pezeshki, P.S.; Noushabadi, A.K.; Ghasemi, H.","Background Acute kidney injury is a complication of COVID-19 and is associated with severity. Despite no specific antiviral treatment strategy, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir have been used. Data on the association between AKI and receiving antiviral agents with outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is scarce. We aimed to determine the incidence of AKI and its outcomes in COVID-19 patients with and without antiviral medications. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on hospitalized adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in a tertiary center. The primary endpoint was determining mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and length of hospitalization affected by AKI development using antiviral agents. The logistic regression method was used to explore the predictive effects of AKI and antiviral therapy on composite outcomes (i.e., mortality, ICU admission, and prolonged hospitalization) in four defined groups by AKI development/not and utilizing antivirals/not. We used IBM SPSS version 24.0 software for statistical analysis. Results Out of 833 COVID-19 patients who were included, 75 patients were treated with antiviral agents and developed AKI. There was a significant difference in the occurrence of AKI and using antiviral medications (p = 0.001). Also, the group using antiviral agents and the development of AKI had the highest rate of preexisting hypertension (p = 0.002). Of note, the group of patients who used antiviral agents and also developed AKI had the most remarkable association with our composite outcome (p<0.0001), especially ICU admission (OR = 15.22; 95% CI: 8.06–27.32). Conclusions The presence of AKI among COVID-19 patients treated with antiviral agents is linked to increased severity and mortality. Therefore, it is imperative to explore preventive measures for AKI development in patients receiving antiviral therapy. Larger-scale randomized controlled trials may be warranted to provide a more comprehensive understanding of these associations.",2023,NA,"PLoS ONE","10.1371/journal.pone.0292746","#3945",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought to identify plasma biomarkers predictive of MAKE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting & Participants: A total of 576 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 2020 and January 2021 across 3 academic medical centers. Exposure: Twenty-six plasma biomarkers of injury, inflammation, and repair from first available blood samples collected during hospitalization. Outcome: MAKE, defined as KDIGO stage 3 acute kidney injury (AKI), dialysis-requiring AKI, or mortality up to 60 days. Analytical Approach: Cox proportional hazards regression to associate biomarker level with MAKE. We additionally applied the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest regression for prediction modeling and estimated model discrimination with time-varying C index. Results: The median length of stay for COVID-19 hospitalization was 9 (IQR, 5-16) days. In total, 95 patients (16%) experienced MAKE. Each 1 SD increase in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and sTNFR2 was significantly associated with an increased risk of MAKE (adjusted HR [AHR], 2.30 [95% CI, 1.86-2.85], and AHR, 2.26 [95% CI, 1.73-2.95], respectively). The C index of sTNFR1 alone was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.84), and the C index of sTNFR2 was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.77-0.84). LASSO and random forest regression modeling using all biomarkers yielded C indexes of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.83-0.89) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78-0.91), respectively. Limitations: No control group of hospitalized patients without COVID-19. Conclusions: We found that sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 are independently associated with MAKE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and can both also serve as predictors for adverse kidney outcomes. Plain-Language Summary: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are at increased risk for long-term adverse health outcomes, but not all patients suffer long-term kidney dysfunction. Identification of patients with COVID-19 who are at high risk for adverse kidney events may have important implications in terms of nephrology follow-up and patient counseling. In this study, we found that the plasma biomarkers soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and sTNFR2 measured in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were associated with a greater risk of adverse kidney outcomes. Along with clinical variables previously shown to predict adverse kidney events in patients with COVID-19, both sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 are also strong predictors of adverse kidney outcomes.",2023,NA,"American Journal of Kidney Diseases","10.1053/j.ajkd.2023.03.010","#3961",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of this study was to compare the baseline characteristics of patients in two phases of the pandemic and evaluate possible predictors of mortality. Methods: This is a retrospective multicenter observational study that included patients with COVID-19 in 4 different centers in Greece. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the period during which they were infected during the Delta and Omicron variant predominance. Results: A total of 979 patients (433 Delta, 546 Omicron) were included in the study (median age 67 years (54, 81); 452 [46.2%] female). Compared to the Omicron period, the patients during the Delta period were younger (median age [IQR] 65 [51, 77] vs. 70 [55, 83] years, p < 0.001) and required a longer duration of hospitalization (8 [6, 13] vs. 7 [5, 12] days, p = 0.001), had higher procalcitonin levels (ng/mL): 0.08 [0.05, 0.17] vs. 0.06 [0.02, 0.16], p = 0.005, ferritin levels (ng/mL): 301 [159, 644] vs. 239 [128, 473], p = 0.002, C- reactive protein levels (mg/L): 40.4 [16.7, 98.5] vs. 31.8 [11.9, 81.7], p = 0.003, and lactate dehydrogenase levels (U/L): 277 [221, 375] vs. 255 [205, 329], p < 0.001. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was lower (3 [0, 5] vs. 4 [1, 6], p < 0.001), and the extent of disease on computed tomography (CT) was greater during the Delta wave (p < 0.001). No evidence of a difference in risk of death or admission to the intensive care unit was found between the two groups. Age, cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury during hospitalization, extent of disease on chest CT, D-dimer, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio values were identified as independent predictors of mortality for patients in the Delta period. Cardiovascular events and acute liver injury during hospitalization and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission were identified as independent predictors of mortality for patients in the Omicron period. Conclusions: In the Omicron wave, patients were older with a higher number of comorbidities, but patients with the Delta variant had more severe disease and a longer duration of hospitalization.",2023,NA,"Journal of Clinical Medicine","10.3390/jcm12185904","#3962",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Early prediction of AKI is crucial in order to implement preventive strategies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive performance of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 and insulin like growth factor binding protein 7 (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) in critically ill patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational study. SETTING: Twelve centers across Europe and United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Patients with moderate or severe COVID-19-associated ARDS were included and serial measurements of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) were performed. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was the development of moderate or severe AKI according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition. Three hundred patients were available for the primary analysis, and 39 met the primary endpoint. At enrollment, urinary (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) had high predictive value for the primary endpoint with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) was significantly higher in endpoint-positive patients at enrollment and at 12 hours.

This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of AKI in Brazilian hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and identify the risk factors associated with its onset and those associated with its prognosis. Methods: A prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a public and tertiary university hospital in São Paulo from March to December 2020. Results: There were 347 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 52.4% were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and 47.6% were admitted to the wards. The overall incidence of AKI was 46.4%, more frequent in the ICU (68.1% vs 22.4, p < 0.01) and the overall mortality was 36.1%. Acute kidney replacement therapy was indicated in 46.6% of patients with AKI. In the general population, the factors associated with AKI were older age (OR 1.03, CI 1–1.05, p < 0.05), mechanical ventilation (OR 1.23, CI 1.06–1.83, p < 0.05), presence of proteinuria (OR 1.46, CI 1.22–1.93, p < 0.05), and use of vasoactive drugs (OR 1.26, CI 1.07–1.92, p < 0.05).

Here, we assessed model performance during periods when COVID-19 cases were attributable almost exclusively to individual variants. Electronic Health Record data were obtained from patients admitted to 19 hospitals. The outcome was hospital-acquired AKI. The model, previously built in an Inception Cohort, was evaluated in Delta and Omicron cohorts using model discrimination and calibration methods. A total of 9104 patients were included, with 5676 in the Inception Cohort, 2461 in the Delta cohort, and 967 in the Omicron cohort. The Delta Cohort was younger with fewer comorbidities, while Omicron patients had lower rates of intensive care compared with the other cohorts. AKI occurred in 13.7% of the Inception Cohort, compared with 13.8% of Delta and 14.4% of Omicron (Omnibus p = 0.84). Compared with the Inception Cohort (area under the curve (AUC): 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.76–0.80), the model showed stable discrimination in the Delta (AUC: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.75–0.80, p = 0.89) and Omicron (AUC: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.70–0.79, p = 0.37) cohorts.

Methods: We included consecutive adults admitted to the intensive care unit between March 2020 and July 2021. We compared three groups defined by the epidemic intake phase: waves 1 (W1), 2 (W2), and 3 (W3). Results: We included 289 patients. Two hundred and eight (72%) patients were men with a median age of 63 years (IQR: 54-72), of whom 68 (23.6%) died in hospital. High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) was inversely associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in multivariate analysis (p = 0.003) but not dexamethasone (p = 0.25). The day-90 mortality rate did not vary from W1 (27.4%) to W2 (23.9%) and W3 (22%), p = 0.67. By multivariate analysis, older age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94/year, p < 0.001), immunodeficiency (OR: 0.33, p = 0.04), acute kidney injury (OR: 0.26, p < 0.001), and invasive MV (OR: 0.13, p < 0.001) were inversely associated with higher day-90 survival as opposed to the use of intermediate heparin thromboprophylaxis dose (OR: 3.21, p = 0.006). HFNO use and dexamethasone were not associated with higher day-90 survival (p = 0.24 and p = 0.56, respectively). Conclusions: In patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, survival did not change between first, second, and third waves while the use of invasive MV decreased.

"Circulating dipeptidyl peptidase 3 and bio-adrenomedullin levels are associated with impaired outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a prospective international multicentre study","van Lier, D.; Deniau, B.; Santos, K.; Hartmann, O.; Dudoignon, E.; Depret, F.; Plaud, B.; Laterre, P.-F.; Mebazaa, A.; Pickkers, P.","Introduction Dipeptidyl peptidase-3 (DPP3) is a protease involved in the degradation of several cardiovascular mediators. Adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) is a peptide essential for regulation of endothelial barrier function. In different shock-pathologies, both biomarkers are associated with disease severity, organ dysfunction and mortality. Associations with outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients are unknown. The objectives of the present study were to investigate associations of bio-ADM and “circulating DPP3” (cDPP3) with short-term outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients (n=80). Methods A multicentre prospective cohort study was performed. The primary end-point was 28-day mortality. Secondary end-points included different severities of acute kidney injury (AKI). Results cDPP3 levels were mainly associated with 28-day mortality; Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) of 0.69 (0.56–0.82, p=0.023), 0.77 (0.64–0.90, p<0.001) and 0.81 (0.65–0.96, p<0.001) at admission, day 3 and day 7, respectively. In contrast, bio-ADM levels were mainly associated with AKI, with AUROCs of 0.64 (0.51–0.77, p=0.048), 0.75 (0.64–0.86, p<0.001) and 0.83 (0.74–0.93, p<0.001) for day 1, 3 and 7, respectively. Interestingly, patients with high levels of both cDPP3 and bio-ADM at day 7 had an additionally increased risk of 28-day mortality (hazard ratio 11.8; 95% CI 2.5–55.3, p<0.001). Conclusions cDPP3 and bio-ADM responses were associated with short-term mortality and AKI in critically ill COVID-19 patients, respectively. These findings suggest that treatment with specific antibodies modulating cDPP3 or bio-ADM-related pathways may improve outcome of COVID-19.",2023,NA,"ERJ Open Research","10.1183/23120541.00342-2022","#4190",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods: A retrospective multi-centre observational cohort study comprising 12,891 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction from 1 January 2020 to 10 September 2020, and with at least one serum creatinine value 1–365 days prior to admission. Mortality and serum creatinine values were obtained up to 10 September 2021. Findings: Advanced age (HR 2.77, 95%CI 2.53–3.04, p < 0.0001), severe COVID-19 (HR 2.91, 95%CI 2.03–4.17, p < 0.0001), severe AKI (KDIGO stage 3: HR 4.22, 95%CI 3.55–5.00, p < 0.0001), and ischemic heart disease (HR 1.26, 95%CI 1.14–1.39, p < 0.0001) were associated with worse mortality outcomes. AKI severity (KDIGO stage 3: HR 0.41, 95%CI 0.37–0.46, p < 0.0001) was associated with worse kidney function recovery, whereas remdesivir use (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.17–1.54, p < 0.0001) was associated with better kidney function recovery.

"Kinetics of the Cell Cycle Arrest Biomarkers (TIMP2 and IGFBP7) for the Diagnosis of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients","Greco, M.; De Rosa, S.; Boehm, F.; Spano, S.; Aceto, R.; Voza, A.; Reggiani, F.; Calatroni, M.; Castellani, G.; Costantini, E.; Villa, G.; Cecconi, M.","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is highly prevalent in critical COVID-19 patients. The diagnosis and staging of AKI are based on serum creatinine (sCr) and urinary output criteria, with limitations in the functional markers. New cell-cycle arrest biomarkers [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] have been proposed for early detection of AKI, but their role in critically ill COVID-19 patients is poorly understood. Methods: We conducted an observational study to assess the performance of [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] for the detection of AKI in critical COVID-19 patients admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). We sampled urinary [TIMP2]*[IGFBP7] levels at ICU admission, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h, and compared the results to the development of AKI, as well as baseline and laboratory data. Results: Forty-one patients were enrolled. The median age was 66 years [57–72] and most were males (85%). Thirteen patients (31.7%) developed no/mild stage AKI, 19 patients (46.3%) moderate AKI, and nine patients (22.0%) severe AKI. The ICU mortality was 29.3%. sCr levels in the Emergency Department or at ICU admission were not significantly different according to AKI stage. [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP-7] urinary levels were elevated in severe AKI at 12 h after ICU admission, but not at ICU admission or 24 h or 48 h after ICU admission. Conclusion: Urinary biomarkers [TIMP-2]*[IGFBP-7] were generally increased in this population with a high prevalence of AKI, and were higher in patients with severe AKI measured at 12 h from ICU admission. Further studies are needed to evaluate the best timing of these biomarkers in this population.",2023,NA,"Diagnostics","10.3390/diagnostics13020317","#4206",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Statin therapy may protect against acute kidney injury in patients hospitalized for interstitial SARS-CoV2 pneumonia","Piani, F.; Di Salvo, E.; Landolfo, M.; Saracino, I.M.; Agnoletti, D.; Borghi, C.; Fiorini, G.","Background and aims: COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) represents an independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital death in patients with COVID-19. Chronic statin therapy use is highly prevalent in individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. Our aim is to assess whether patients under treatment with statins have a lower risk of AKI and in-hospital mortality during hospitalization for interstitial SARS-CoV2 pneumonia. Methods and results: Our study is a prospective observational study on 269 consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia at the Internal Medicine Unit of IRCCS Sant'Orsola Hospital in Bologna, Italy. We compared the clinical characteristics between patients receiving statin therapy (n = 65) and patients not treated with statins and we assessed if chronic statin use was associated with a reduced risk for AKI, all-cause mortality, admission to ICU, and disease severity. Statin use was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing AKI (OR 0.47, IC 0.23 to 0.95, p 0.036) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Additionally, statin use was associated with reduced C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (p 0.048) at hospital admission. No significant impact in risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.98, IC 0.71 to 5.50, p 0.191) and ICU admission (HR 0.93, IC 0.52 to 1.65, p 0.801) was observed with statin use, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and CKD.

Characterization of AKI by timing and trajectory and early prediction of AKI progression is required for better preventive management and the prediction of patient outcomes. Methods: A total of 858 patients who were hospitalized due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were retrospectively enrolled from December 2020 to August 2021. The occurrence of AKI was evaluated throughout hospitalization. The hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality outcomes according to the trajectory of AKI were measured using Cox regression models after adjustment for multiple variables. Results: Among 858 patients, 226 (26.3%) presented AKI at admission, and 44 (5.1%) developed AKI during hospitalization. Patients with AKI at admission or hospital-acquired AKI had a higher risk of mortality than those without AKI, with HRs of 9.87 (2.81–34.67) and 13.74 (3.57–52.84), respectively. Of 226 patients with AKI at admission, 104 (46.0%) recovered within 48 hr, 83 (36.7%) had AKI beyond 48 hr and recovered in 7 days, and 39 (17.3%) showed no recovery from AKI on Day 7. Delayed recovery and persistent AKI were significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality, with HRs of 4.39 (1.06–18.24) and 24.33 (7.10–83.36), respectively.

"Prognostic significance of early acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation: a single-center retrospective analysis","Sitina, M.; Sramek, V.; Helan, M.; Suk, P.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with impaired outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, the prognostic significance of early AKI is poorly described. We aimed to determine whether AKI on admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and its development within the first 48 h predict the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and increased mortality. An analysis of 372 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation without advanced chronic kidney disease from 2020 to 2021 was performed. The AKI stages on ICU admission and Day 2 were determined using adapted KDIGO criteria. The early development of renal function was assessed by the change in AKI score and the Day-2/Day-0 creatinine ratio. Data were compared between three consecutive COVID-19 waves and with data before the pandemic. Both ICU and 90-day mortality (79% and 93% vs. 35% and 44%) and the need for RRT increased markedly with advanced AKI stage on ICU admission. Similarly, an early increase in AKI stage and creatinine implied highly increased mortality. RRT was associated with very high ICU and 90-day mortality (72% and 85%), even surpassing that of patients on ECMO. No difference was found between consecutive COVID-19 waves, except for a lower mortality in the patients on RRT in the last omicron wave. Mortality and need for RRT were comparable in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 patients, except that RRT did not increase ICU mortality in the pre-COVID-19 era. In conclusion, we confirmed the prognostic significance of both AKI on ICU admission and its early development in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",2023,NA,"Renal Failure","10.1080/0886022X.2023.2205954","#4236",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Prognostic potential of creatinine and Cystatin C in COVID-19–a retrospective cohort study from Karolinska University Hospital","Sjöström, A.; Markgren, P.O.; Hansson, M.","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in COVID-19 and is diagnosed using relative serum creatinine increase. Estimated GFR (eGFR) is a more accurate measure of glomerular filtration due to compensation for age and sex. Serum Cystatin-C, less affected by non-renal factors than creatinine, may further improve renal function estimation and add prognostic information. Our aim is to investigate the importance of a calculated eGFR in relation to creatinine as well as the value of Cystatin-C in patients with severe COVID-19. This study is a retrospective cohort study investigating levels and trends of routine laboratory parameters combined with clinical data from 286 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 from Karolinska University Hospital. AKI developed in 38% of the patients and 15% were treated with hemodialysis. Mortality in the AKI group was 42% compared to 5% in the non-AKI group. At admission, eGFR, but not creatinine, was significantly associated with AKI development, need of intubation and mortality. Moreover, discrepant results between eGFR creatinine (eGFRCR) and eGFR Cystatin-C (eGFRCYS) was common in the ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients and related to outcome. In addition, we found that daily median Cystatin-C levels during the hospital stay were correlated to neutrophil count. eGFRCR was found to be an overall better prognostic marker than creatinine regarding AKI development and prognosis in severe COVID-19. Fulfillment of Shrunken pore syndrome criteria indicated a higher mortality risk.

The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of AKI in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with critically ill COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: A multicenter retrospective study in Saudi Arabia of adult patients aged at least 18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and admitted to the intensive care unit between May 2020 and May 2021 was conducted. The occurrence of AKI and associated risk factors, the need for continous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), and the outcome were reported. Results: The study included 340 patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Their mean age was 66.7±13.4 years, ranging from 49 to 84 years, and most of them were men (63.8%). The most common concomitant diseases were hypertension (71.5%), diabetes (62.4%), IHD (37.6%), CKD (20%), heart failure (19.4%), and 81.2% suffered from ARDS. AKI occurred in 60.3% of patients, 38% were stage 1, 16.6% were stage 2, and 45.4% were stage 3. Approximately, 39% of patients required CRRT, out of which 76.2% were stage 3, which was significantly higher than the other stages (p<0.001). AKI patients suffered significantly from asthma and had lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and higher creatinine levels than patients without AKI (p<0.05 all).

Kidney damage associated with COVID-19 could take specific features due to environmental and socio-cultural factors. This study evaluates the incidence of AKI, the associated factors, and mortality in COVID-19 patients in a Sub-Saharan African intensive care unit. Methods: In a prospective cohort study conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Centre Médical de Kinshasa (CMK), consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 were screened for the presence of AKI between 27 March, 2020 and 27 January 2022. AKI was defined according to Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. The primary outcome was occurrence of AKI. The secondary outcome was 48 days’ mortality and recovery of the renal function at intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Survival (time-to death) curves were built using the Kaplan Meier methods. Multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression to identify factors associated with AKI and Cox regression to explore the association between AKI and in-hospital mortality. The significance level of the p-value was set at 0.05. Results: The median(IQR) sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) score and mean age of patients (215) including in our cohort were respectively 3(2-4) and 58.9 ± 14.9 years. The incidence of AKI was 28.4% with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI accounted for 39.3%, 11.5%, and 49.2%, respectively. Hemodialysis was required in 16 out 215 (7.4%) patients. Dyspnea (adjusted odds ratio (aOR):2.27 [1.1–-4.57] p = 0.021), SOFA ≥5 (aOR:3.11[1.29–7.53] p = 0.012), AST/ALT ratio (aOR: 1.53 [1.09–1.79] p = 0.015), N/L ratio (aOR:2.09 [1.09–3.20] p = 0.016), mechanical ventilation (aOR: 3.20 [1.66–10.51] p = 0.005) and Amikacin (aOR: 2.91 [1.37–6.18] p = 0.006) were the main factors associated with AKI. Patients with AKI had a mortality rate of 52.5% and 67.2% of the survivors did not recover kidney function at the end of hospitalization. Adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed that COVID-19-associated AKI was independently associated with in-hospital death (HR:2.96 [1.93–4.65] p = 0.013) compared to non-AKI patients. Conclusions: AKI was present in three out of ten COVID-19 patients. The most significant factors associated with AKI were dyspnea, SOFA ≥ 5, AST/ALT and N/L ratio, mechanical ventilation and Amikacin.

"Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in Bulgarian COVID-19 patients with or without chronic kidney disease","Filev, R.; Rostaing, L.; Lyubomirova, M.; Bogov, B.; Kalinov, K.; Svinarov, D.","When angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker-treated patients present with SARS-CoV-2 infection there is a debate to know whether renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) blockers should be stopped or not. We conducted a prospective observational study in Bulgarian COVID-19-infected patients with or without chronic kidney disease (CKD) to assess whether maintenance RAAS blocker therapy has an impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications. We included 120 in-patient COVID-19 subjects, of whom 70 had CKD and 50 had normal renal function. A total of 30% of the patients (total number of 36 patients, 21 females) were receiving RAAS therapy at admission and it was maintained throughout hospitalization. The overall mortality was 19.2% (23 patients); there was no significant difference across the 2 groups (P-value=.21), except in RAAS blockers-treated hypertensive patients who had a significantly lower mortality as compared to non-RAAS-blockers-treated hypertensive patients (P=.04). Regarding subsequent intensive-care unit admission, there were 50% less patients in the RAAS group (4 out of 36, i.e., 11%) as compared to 19 out of 84 from the non-RAAS group, that is, 22.6% (P=.29). Overall, 37 patients developed acute kidney injury (any stage by KDIGO); of them 14 (37.8%) were receiving RAAS blockers. Acute kidney injury was not significantly associated with the use of RAAS blockers (P-value=.28). Likewise, both in non-CKD and in CKD patients the use of RAAS blockers did not have an impact on renal function recovery after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, regarding RAAS blockers and the biological parameters outcome only D-dimers were significantly lower at the follow-up as compared to that in non-RAAS blocker treated patients.

We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of AKI and use of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in critical COVID-19, to assess patient and kidney outcomes and risk factors for AKI and differences in outcome when the diagnosis of AKI is based on urine output (UO) or on serum creatinine (sCr). Methods: Multicenter, retrospective cohort analysis of patients with critical COVID-19 in seven large hospitals in Belgium. AKI was defined according to KDIGO within 21 days after ICU admission. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors for developing AKI and to assess the association between AKI and ICU mortality. Results: Of 1286 patients, 85.1% had AKI, and KRT was used in 9.8%. Older age, obesity, a higher APACHE II score and use of mechanical ventilation at day 1 of ICU stay were associated with an increased risk for AKI. After multivariable adjustment, all AKI stages were associated with ICU mortality. AKI was based on sCr in 40.1% and UO in 81.5% of patients. All AKI stages based on sCr and AKI stage 3 based on UO were associated with ICU mortality. Persistent AKI was present in 88.6% and acute kidney disease (AKD) in 87.6%. Rapid reversal of AKI yielded a better prognosis compared to persistent AKI and AKD. Kidney recovery was observed in 47.4% of surviving AKI patients. Conclusions: Over 80% of critically ill COVID-19 patients had AKI. This was driven by the high occurrence rate of AKI defined by UO criteria.

This study aimed to develop a prognostic score for predicting the need for KRT in hospitalised COVID-19 patients, and to assess the incidence of AKI and KRT requirement. Methods: This study is part of a multicentre cohort, the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry. A total of 5212 adult COVID-19 patients were included between March/2020 and September/2020. Variable selection was performed using generalised additive models (GAM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for score derivation. Accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Results: The median age of the model-derivation cohort was 59 (IQR 47–70) years, 54.5% were men, 34.3% required ICU admission, 20.9% evolved with AKI, 9.3% required KRT, and 15.1% died during hospitalisation. The temporal validation cohort had similar age, sex, ICU admission, AKI, required KRT distribution and in-hospital mortality. The geographic validation cohort had similar age and sex; however, this cohort had higher rates of ICU admission, AKI, need for KRT and in-hospital mortality. Four predictors of the need for KRT were identified using GAM: need for mechanical ventilation, male sex, higher creatinine at hospital presentation and diabetes. The MMCD score had excellent discrimination in derivation (AUROC 0.929, 95% CI 0.918–0.939) and validation (temporal AUROC 0.927, 95% CI 0.911–0.941; geographic AUROC 0.819, 95% CI 0.792–0.845) cohorts and good overall performance (Brier score: 0.057, 0.056 and 0.122, respectively). The score is implemented in a freely available online risk calculator (https://www.mmcdscore.com/). Conclusions: The use of the MMCD score to predict the need for KRT may assist healthcare workers in identifying hospitalised COVID-19 patients who may require more intensive monitoring, and can be useful for resource allocation.",2022,NA,"BMC Medicine","10.1186/s12916-022-02503-0","#4327",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The principal component analysis indicated that in subclinical AKI, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and interferon (IFN)-α were associated with a lower risk of AKI, while interleukin-12 (IL-12) and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1β were associated with a higher risk of AKI. After the manifestation of AKI, EGF and IFN-α remained associated with a lower risk of AKI, while IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferon-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and IL-5 were associated with a higher risk of AKI. EGF had an inverse correlation with kidney stress biomarkers. Subclinical AKI was characterized by a significant up-regulation of kidney stress biomarkers and proinflammatory cytokines.

We aimed to explore the changes in AKI epidemiology between the first and the second COVID wave in the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: This was an observational study of critically ill adult patients with COVID-19 in an expanded tertiary care intensive care unit (ICU) in London, UK. Baseline characteristics, organ support, COVID-19 treatments, and patient and kidney outcomes up to 90 days after discharge from hospital were compared. Results: A total of 772 patients were included in the final analysis (68% male, mean age 56 ± 13.6). Compared with wave 1, patients in wave 2 were older, had higher body mass index and clinical frailty score, but lower baseline serum creatinine and C-reactive protein (CRP). The proportion of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) on ICU admission was lower in wave 2 (61% vs 80%; p < 0.001). AKI incidence within 14 days of ICU admission was 76% in wave 1 and 51% in wave 2 (p < 0.001); in wave 1, 32% received KRT compared with 13% in wave 2 (p < 0.001). Patients in wave 2 had significantly lower daily cumulative fluid balance (FB) than in wave 1. Fewer patients were dialysis dependent at 90 days in wave 2 (1% vs. 4%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: In critically ill adult patients admitted to ICU with COVID-19, the risk of AKI and receipt of KRT significantly declined in the second wave.

Abundant evidence exists concerning the epidemiology of AKI in patients hospitalized in the ICU for COVID-19 but limited data are available about the occurrence of AKI in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients being hospitalized in a non-ICU setting. Aim and Methods: We have carried out a retrospective study to evaluate frequency and risk factors for AKI among patients consecutively admitted at a third-level university hospital starting from February 2020 (the beginning of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic); all patients were hospitalized outside the ICU. Results: A total of 387 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were included in the current study; 372 (96.1%) had SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia. In-hospital AKI onset was recorded in 119 (30.7%) patients, mainly with AKI stage 1 (n = 74, 62.2%); eighteen (4.6%) patients reported AKI stage 3 and six (1.5%) patients had HD-dependent AKI.

Methods: This is a longitudinal study performed with hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Serum levels of 27 immune mediators were measured by a multiplex immunoassay. Data were analyzed at two timepoints during the follow-up: within the first 13 days of the disease onset (early sample) and from the 14th day to death or hospital discharge (follow-up sample). Results: We studied 82 COVID-19 patients (59.5 ± 17.5 years, 54.9% male). Of these, 34 (41.5%) developed AKI. These patients presented higher SARS-CoV-2 viral load (P = 0.03), higher frequency of diabetes (P = 0.01) and death (P = 0.0004). Overall, AKI patients presented significantly higher and sustained levels (P < 0.05) of CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-4, CXCL-8, CXCL-10, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1Ra, IL-10 and VEGF. Importantly, higher levels of CCL-2, CXCL-10, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-10, FGFb, and VEGF were observed in AKI patients independently of death. ROC curves demonstrated that early alterations in CCL-2, CXCL-8, CXCL-10, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1Ra and IL-10 show a good predictive value regarding AKI development. Lastly, immune mediators were significantly associated with each other and with SARS-CoV-2 viral load in AKI patients. Conclusions: COVID-19 associated AKI is accompanied by substantial alterations in circulant levels of immune mediators, which could significantly contribute to the establishment of kidney injury.",2022,NA,"Cytokine","10.1016/j.cyto.2022.155974","#4454",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"A Prospective Study on Risk Factors for Acute Kidney Injury and All-Cause Mortality in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients From Tehran (Iran)","Rostami, Z.; Mastrangelo, G.; Einollahi, B.; Nemati, E.; Shafiee, S.; Ebrahimi, M.; Javanbakht, M.; Saadat, S.H.; Amini, M.; Einollahi, Z.; Beyram, B.; Cegolon, L.","Background: Several reports suggested that acute kidney injury (AKI) is a relatively common occurrence in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but its prevalence is inconsistently reported across different populations. Moreover, it is unknown whether AKI results from a direct infection of the kidney by SARS-CoV-2 or it is a consequence of the physiologic disturbances and therapies used to treat COVID-19. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of AKI since it varies by geographical settings, time periods, and populations studied and to investigate whether clinical information and laboratory findings collected at hospital admission might influence AKI incidence (and mortality) in a particular point in time during hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods: Herein we conducted a prospective longitudinal study investigating the prevalence of AKI and associated factors in 997 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Baqiyatallah general hospital of Tehran (Iran), collecting both clinical information and several dates (of: birth; hospital admission; AKI onset; ICU admission; hospital discharge; death). In order to examine how the clinical factors influenced AKI incidence and all-cause mortality during hospitalization, survival analysis using the Cox proportional-hazard models was adopted. Two separate multiple Cox regression models were fitted for each outcome (AKI and death). Results: In this group of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of AKI was 28.5% and the mortality rate was 19.3%. AKI incidence was significantly enhanced by diabetes, hyperkalemia, higher levels of WBC count, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). COVID-19 patients more likely to die over the course of their hospitalization were those presenting a joint association between ICU admission with either severe COVID-19 or even mild/moderate COVID-19, hypokalemia, and higher levels of BUN, WBC, and LDH measured at hospital admission. Diabetes and comorbidities did not increase the mortality risk among these hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Since the majority of patients developed AKI after ICU referral and 40% of them were admitted to ICU within 2 days since hospital admission, these patients may have been already in critical clinical conditions at admission, despite being affected by a mild/moderate form of COVID-19, suggesting the need of early monitoring of these patients for the onset of eventual systemic complications.",2022,NA,"Frontiers in Immunology","10.3389/fimmu.2022.874426","#4503",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"A retrospective cohort study of risk factors and outcomes in older patients admitted to an inner-city geriatric unit in London during first peak of COVID-19 pandemic","Maniero, C.; Patel, D.; Pavithran, A.; Naran, P.; Ng, F.L.; Prowle, J.; Sivapathasuntharam, D.","Purpose: Compared to younger patients, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical presentation in older people can be more heterogeneous and fatal. We aim to describe a cohort of older adults admitted in an inner-city London hospital during the first peak of the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective observational study that enrolled older adults consecutively admitted into two geriatric wards with suspected or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We collected socio-demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms at presentation and/or during admission, biochemical and radiological data and outcomes at 28 days. Results: One hundred twenty-four patients were included, and 75% were > 80 years old. 19.5% of COVID-19 cases were judged to be hospital-acquired. More than half presented or developed typical symptoms, respiratory failure or fatigue. 46.8% were diagnosed with delirium, 24.2% with falls and dysphagia was present in 13.7%. The mortality rate was 29.8% and was higher among males, those > 80 years, patients with a higher grade of frailty, a history of dementia or chronic kidney disease, as well as those diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute kidney injury or hypernatremia. Independent predictors of mortality were male sex, age > 80 years, respiratory failure and hypernatremia. Conclusion: We have described a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first UK peak of the global pandemic. We found that these patients had significant frailty with multiple comorbidities. There was a high mortality and increased dependency and greater social care need in survivors.",2022,NA,"Irish Journal of Medical Science","10.1007/s11845-021-02679-z","#4559",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Endotoxemia in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19","Khan, S.; Bolotova, O.; Sahib, H.; Foster, D.; Mallipattu, S.K.","Introduction: Mechanism(s) mediating critical illness in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain unclear. Previous reports demonstrate the existence of endotoxemia in viral infections without superimposed gram-negative bacteremia, but the rate and severity of endotoxemia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 requires further exploration. Materials and Methods: This is a single-center cross-sectional study of 92 intensive care unit patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Endotoxin activity (EA) was measured in patients that met the following criteria: (1) age ≥18 years and (2) multi-organ dysfunction score >9 from March 24, 2020, to June 20, 2020. Results: A total of 32 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for measurement of EA. The median age of the study cohort was 60 years with a majority male (21/32, 65%) with hypertension (50%). A significant proportion of the patients exhibited either elevated EA in the intermediate range (0.40-0.59 EA units) (10/32, 31%) or high range (≥0.60 EA units) (14/32, 44%) or were nonresponders (NRs, low neutrophil response) to EA (6/32, 19%), with the presence of gram-negative bacteremia only in 2/32 (6%) patients. Low EA was reported in 2/32 patients. NRs (5/6, 83%) and patients with high EA (7/14, 50%) exhibited higher acute kidney injury (AKI) as compared to patients with low/intermediate EA level (1/12, 8.3%). Discussion/Conclusion: Elevated EA was observed in a large majority of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and multi-organ dysfunction despite a low incidence of concurrent gram-negative bacteremia. While we observed that elevated EA and nonresponsiveness to EA were associated with AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19, these findings require further validation in larger longitudinal cohorts.",2022,NA,"Blood Purification","10.1159/000518230","#4561",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Changes of Acute Kidney Injury Epidemiology during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Esposito, P.; Russo, E.; Picciotto, D.; Cappadona, F.; Battaglia, Y.; Traverso, G.B.; Viazzi, F.","To evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic on the epidemiology of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients, we performed a retrospective cohort study comparing data of patients hospitalized from January 2016 to December 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) and from January to December 2020 (COVID-19 period, including both severe acute respi-ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-negative and positive patients). AKI was classified by evaluating the kinetics of creatinine levels. A total of 51,681 patients during the pre-COVID-19 period and 10,062 during the COVID-19 period (9026 SARS-CoV-2-negative and 1036 SARS-CoV-2-positive) were analyzed. Patients admitted in the COVID-19 period were significantly older, with a higher prevalence of males. In-hospital AKI incidence was 31.7% during the COVID-19 period (30.5% in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients and 42.2% in SARS-CoV-2-positive ones) as compared to 25.9% during the pre-COVID-19 period (p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, AKI development was independently associated with both SARS-CoV-2 infection and admission period. Moreover, evaluating the pre-admission estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) we found that during the COVID-19 period, there was an increase in AKI stage 2–3 incidence both in patients with pre-admission eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (“de novo” AKI). Similarly, clinical outcomes evaluated as intensive care unit admission, length of hospital stay, and mortality were significantly worse in patients admitted in the COVID-19 period. Additionally, in this case, the mortality was independently correlated with the admission during the COVID-19 period and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, in-hospital AKI epidemiology has changed, not only for patients affected by COVID-19. These modifications underline the necessity to rethink AKI management during health emergencies.",2022,NA,"Journal of Clinical Medicine","10.3390/jcm11123349","#4571",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
