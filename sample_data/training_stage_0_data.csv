"Acute Kidney Injury Among Admitted COVID-19 Patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","Goffe, T.K.; Alemu, Z.A.; Derese, T.N.; Tilahun, R.B.; Tilahun, Y.B.","Background: Although diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure are the most common symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019, other organ involvement, such as the kidney, has been reported. The incidence of acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients has been reported to vary greatly. In this study, we look at the magnitude and risk factors for acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients in Ethiopia, a developing country. Methods: A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study design was conducted among admitted COVID-19 patients at Eka Kotebe general hospital and Saint Peter COVID-19 treatment center by reviewing data from September 2020 to September 2021. A random sampling technique with proportional size allocation was used to select a total sample of 402 patients (225 from Eka Kotebe and 177 from St. Peter). Secondary data was collected from patient medical records using a standard, pre-tested data collection checklist using the Kobo toolbox, which was then exported to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. The association between dependent and independent variables was analyzed using binary logistic regression. A statistical significance test was declared at a p value of <=0.05 with a 95% confidence interval. Results: A total of 402 patient charts were reviewed, and the proportion of patients with acute kidney injury was found to be 18.9%. After adjusting for potential confounders, age<=35 years (AOR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.07–0.72), female gender (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.28–0.94), and isolation type ICU (AOR = 5.11, 95% CI = 1.44–18.06) were significantly associated with acute kidney injury. Conclusion: Acute kidney injury is a common complication in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The prevalence of acute kidney injury in this study was 18.9%. Age, gender, and type of isolation were the factors that had a significant association with acute kidney injury. Clinicians and other concerned parties should provide more care to ICU patients and COVID-19 patients who are older.",2023,NA,"International Journal of Nephrology and Renovascular Disease","10.2147/IJNRD.S402946","#4240",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Sugar is not always sweet: exploring the relationship between hyperglycemia and COVID-19 in a predominantly African American population","Skwiersky, S.; Rosengarten, S.; Meisel, T.; MacAluso, F.; Chang, M.; Thomson, A.; Da Silva, B.; Oommen, A.; Salvani, J.; Banerji, M.A.","Introduction The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of admission glucose in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 with and without diabetes mellitus in a largely African American cohort. Design and methods This study included 708 adults (89% non-Hispanic Black) admitted with COVID-19 to an urban hospital between 1 March and 15 May 2020. Patients with diabetes were compared with those without and were stratified based on admission glucose of 140 and 180 mg/dL. Adjusted ORs were calculated for outcomes of mortality, intubation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute kidney injury (AKI), and length of stay based on admission glucose levels. Results Patients with diabetes with admission glucose >140 mg/dL (vs <140 g/dL) had 2.4-fold increased odds of intubation (95% CI 1.2 to 4.6) and 2.1-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI 1.0 to 4.3). Patients with diabetes with admission glucose >180 mg/dL (vs <180 g/dL) had a 1.9-fold increased mortality (95% CI 1.2 to 3.1). Patients without diabetes with admission glucose >140 mg/dL had a 2.3-fold increased mortality (95% CI 1.3 to 4.3), 2.7-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI 1.3 to 5.4), 1.9-fold increased odds of intubation (95% CI 1.0 to 3.7) and 2.2-fold odds of AKI (95% CI 1.1 to 3.8). Patients without diabetes with glucose >180 mg/dL had 4.4-fold increased odds of mortality (95% CI 1.9 to 10.4), 2.7-fold increased odds of intubation (95% CI 1.2 to 5.8) and 3-fold increased odds of ICU admission (95% CI 1.3 to 6.6). Conclusion Our results show hyperglycemia portends worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with and without diabetes. While our study was limited by its retrospective design, our findings suggest that patients presenting with hyperglycemia require closer observation and more aggressive therapies.",2022,NA,"BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care","10.1136/bmjdrc-2021-002692","#4475",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Association between the Use of Antibiotics and the Development of Acute Renal Injury in Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19 in a Hospital in the Peruvian Amazon","Romaní, L.; León-Figueroa, D.A.; Rafael-Navarro, D.; Barboza, J.J.; Rodriguez-Morales, A.J.","Introduction: A significant antibiotic prescribing pattern associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been described. Multiple protocols included empirical antimicrobials, leading to a substantial increase in antimicrobial consumption in medical care. A higher mortality rate is described among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who received antibiotics. Objectives: To determine the association between the use of antibiotics and the development of acute renal injury in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in patients treated at the Hospital II EsSalud de Ucayali, 2021. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted, evaluating the medical records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit between July 2020 and July 2021. For the statistical analysis, measures of central tendency and dispersion, statistical hypothesis contrast tests were used in relation to acute kidney injury (AKI), antibiotic use and associated factors, derived from linear regression models. Results: The factors that were positively associated with the development of AKI were sepsis (aPR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.26–6.43), shock (aPR:2.49; 95% CI: 1.28–4.86), mechanical ventilation (aPR:9.11; 95% CI: 1.23–67.57), and use of vancomycin (aPR: 3.15; 95% CI: 1.19–8.27). Conclusions: In the Peruvian Amazon, there is a high consumption and inadequate prescription of antibiotics. The drugs most commonly used for the treatment of COVID-19 were: aminoglycosides, vancomycin, ivermectin, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and corticosteroids. The development of AKI among hospitalized patients was found to be related to vancomycin administration. In addition, an association was found with the use of mechanical ventilation, a high body mass index, and the presence of complications such as sepsis or shock. Therefore, inappropriate antibiotic use for COVID-19 has been associated with multiple negative outcomes and consequences.",2022,NA,"Journal of Clinical Medicine","10.3390/jcm11154493","#4488",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Myocardial injury and its correlation to mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients: A retrospective cohort study","Ababneh, M.J.; Al-Kasasbeh, A.; Jarrah, M.; Malkawi, L.; Sanduka, O.; Smadi, A.M.; Smadi, M.M.","Purpose: This retrospective observational study was conducted to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with positive cardiac enzymes in the King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) in Irbid, Jordan. Patients and methods: A total of 676 patients admitted to KAUH for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 were included in the study. Clinical and mortality data were collected from patients’ electronic medical records. Results: A significant association was found between myocardial injury and In-hospital mortality. Seven comorbidities were identified as risk factors for myocardial injury: Hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiac arrhythmias. The need for intensive care unit (ICU) for invasive ventilation was also associated with myocardial injury. Acute kidney injury (AKI) during hospitalization had a significantly higher incidence of myocardial injury and mortality. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) and acute peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were also associated with higher mortality. Conclusion: Myocardial injury is an important predictor of mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease. Patients with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, any vascular diseases, cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure are considered high-risk for adverse outcome. Additionally, COVID-19 patients with myocardial injury and acute kidney injury were recognized with the highest mortality rate.",2022,NA,"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","10.3389/fcvm.2022.1039655","#4362",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Sex differences and disparities in cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19","Bugiardini, R.; Nava, S.; Caramori, G.; Yoon, J.; Badimon, L.; Bergami, M.; Cenko, E.; David, A.; Demiri, I.; Dorobantu, M.; Fronea, O.; Jankovic, R.; Kedev, S.; Ladjevic, N.; Lasica, R.; Loncar, G.; Mancuso, G.; Mendieta, G.; Miličić, D.; Mjehović, P.; Pašalić, M.; Petrović, M.; Poposka, L.; Scarpone, M.; Stefanovic, M.; van der Schaar, M.; Vasiljevic, Z.; Vavlukis, M.; Pittao, M.L.V.; Vukomanovic, V.; Zdravkovic, M.; Manfrini, O.","Aims Previous analyses on sex differences in case fatality rates at population-level data had limited adjustment for key patient clinical characteristics thought to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. We aimed to estimate the risk of specific organ dysfunctions and mortality in women and men. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study included 17 hospitals within 5 European countries participating in the International Survey and results of Acute Coronavirus Syndromes COVID-19 (NCT05188612). Participants were individuals hospitalized with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 2020 to February 2022. Risk-adjusted ratios (RRs) of in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure (ARF), acute heart failure (AHF), and acute kidney injury (AKI) were calculated for women vs. men. Estimates were evaluated by inverse probability weighting and logistic regression models. The overall care cohort included 4499 patients with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Of these, 1524 (33.9%) were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), and 1117 (24.8%) died during hospitalization. Compared with men, women were less likely to be admitted to ICU [RR: 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71–0.91]. In general wards (GWs) and ICU cohorts, the adjusted women-to-men RRs for in-hospital mortality were of 1.13 (95% CI: 0.90–1.42) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70–1.05; pinteraction = 0.04). Development of AHF, AKI, and ARF was associated with increased mortality risk (odds ratios: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.73–2.98; 3.85, 95% CI: 3.21–4.63; and 3.95, 95% CI: 3.04–5.14, respectively). The adjusted RRs for AKI and ARF were comparable among women and men regardless of intensity of care. In contrast, female sex was associated with higher odds for AHF in GW, but not in ICU (RRs: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.94–1.67 vs. 0.83; 95% CI: 0.59–1.16, pinteraction = 0.04). Conclusions Women in GW were at increased risk of AHF and in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 compared with men. For patients receiving ICU care, fatal complications including AHF and mortality appeared to be independent of sex. Equitable access to COVID-19 ICU care is needed to minimize the unfavourable outcome of women presenting with COVID-19-related complications.",2023,NA,"Cardiovascular Research","10.1093/cvr/cvad011","#4071",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Long-short-term memory machine learning of longitudinal clinical data accurately predicts acute kidney injury onset in COVID-19: a two-center study","Lu, J.Y.; Zhu, J.; Duong, T.Q.","Objectives: This study used the long-short-term memory (LSTM) artificial intelligence method to model multiple time points of clinical laboratory data, along with demographics and comorbidities, to predict hospital-acquired acute kidney injury (AKI) onset in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Montefiore Health System data consisted of 1982 AKI and 2857 non-AKI (NAKI) hospitalized patients with COVID-19, and Stony Brook Hospital validation data consisted of 308 AKI and 721 NAKI hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Demographic, comorbidities, and longitudinal (3 days before AKI onset) laboratory tests were analyzed. LSTM was used to predict AKI with fivefold cross-validation (80%/20% for training/validation). Results: The top predictors of AKI onset were glomerular filtration rate, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein. Longitudinal data yielded marked improvement in prediction accuracy over individual time points. The inclusion of comorbidities and demographics further improves prediction accuracy. The best model yielded an area under the curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity to be 0.965 ± 0.003, 89.57 ± 1.64%, 0.95 ± 0.03, and 0.84 ± 0.05, respectively, for the Montefiore validation dataset, and 0.86 ± 0.01, 83.66 ± 2.53%, 0.66 ± 0.10, 0.89 ± 0.03, respectively, for the Stony Brook Hospital validation dataset. Conclusion: LSTM model of longitudinal clinical data accurately predicted AKI onset in patients with COVID-19.

"Outcomes of COVID 19 patients with acute kidney injury in Thi Qar province, south of Iraq","Al-Omer, D.K.","Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with an increased mortality rate among hospitalized patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is not well described. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients who were referred to Al-Hussein Teaching Hospital in Thi-Qar Governorate, Iraq, from 15 February to 15 May 2020, diagnosed with Corona Varus by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) A test with a diagnosis of COVID.-19. AKI was determined according to the outcome criteria for creatinine determination and Introduced by the KDIGO in 2012. Patients were stratified based on recovery, dialysis, and hospital mortality. We also assessed risk indicators associated with AKI during hospitalization along with in-hospital outcomes, recovery rate, and death at the time of discharge. And after three months of going out for both sexes. Results: We evaluated 2044 patients, whose ages ranged from 18 to more than 65 years, for both males and females, and the percentage of males 54.7% and females 45.3% were admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. AKI occurred in 194(8.02%) patients; 55(35.5%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. It was observed that 43.1% of males recovered to 43.8% of the females who were cured inside the hospital, and there was a percentage of patients Those who needed dialysis, and there was a percentage of deaths among males and females. Patients with AKI showed a significantly higher mortality rate. The patients’ condition was followed up after their discharge from the hospital, and the percentage of those who were cured and the patients who needed dialysis was determined, and the rate and mortality. conclusion: We found that male sex, patients' ages, history of chronic kidney disease, and disease severity were independent risk factors associated with AKI in COVID-19 patients. Whereas, acute renal insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of death, increased dialysis patients, and inhospital complications. Our results indicate the need for more careful care and monitoring of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19, and non-recovery of acute renal impairment on hospital discharge is a common complication in these patients.",2023,NA,"Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology","10.47750/jptcp.2023.13.03.008","#4110",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
"Early Renal-Replacement Therapy May Reduce the All-Cause Mortality of Severe COVID-19: An Observational Cohort Study","Qian, J.; Wang, M.; You, H.; Luo, J.; Li, S.; Chen, S.; Chen, Y.; Li, X.; Wang, K.; Zhang, W.; Yuan, L.; Ni, L.; Chen, J.","Introduction: The efficacy of renal-replacement treatment (RRT) remains to be validated in COVID-19. In this retrospective cohort study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of early initiation of RRT in intensive care unit (ICU) adults with severe COVID-19. Methods: Fifty-eight adult patients in ICU with critically ill or severe COVID-19 with a tendency of critical illness were recruited from February 9, 2020, to March 30, 2020. Early RRT were determined by the ICU medical team based on boom in cytokines levels, increased organs injury/failure, and rapid aggravation of condition. All participants were followed up from the first day of ICU admission to March 30, 2020. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality in ICU. Results: The mean age of the cohort was 68.4 ± 14.6 years, with 81.0% having at least one comorbidity before hospitalization. Twenty patients (34.5%) initiated early RRT after 24.1 ± 10.4 days from the onset and 6.4 ± 3.6 days from ICU admission. Thirty-four of 58 participants (58.6%) died during ICU follow-up. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model showed that early RRT was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in ICU with an adjusted HR of 0.280 (95% CI: 0.106-0.738, p = 0.010). Sudden unexpected death (SUD) was remarkably reduced in the early RRT group, compared with the control group (0.2 vs. 2.9 per 100 person-day, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Early RRT can reduce the all-cause in-hospital mortality, especially SUD in patients with severe COVID-19, but not improve multi-organ impairment or increase the risk of AKI. Early initiation of RRT merits an optional strategy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (ChiCTR2000030773).",2022,NA,"Blood Purification","10.1159/000524229","#4314",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We performed a prospective, observational, multicenter study of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in Catalonia (Spain). Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, drug and medical treatment, physiological and laboratory results, AKI development, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) and clinical outcomes were collected. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis for AKI development and mortality were used. A total of 1,642 patients were enrolled (mean age 63 (15.95) years, 67.5% male). Mechanical ventilation (MV) was required for 80.8% and 64.4% of these patients, who were in prone position, while 67.7% received vasopressors. AKI at ICU admission was 28.4% and increased to 40.1% during ICU stay. A total of 172 (10.9%) patients required RRT, which represents 27.8% of the patients who developed AKI. AKI was more frequent in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ARDS patients (68% vs 53.6%, p<0.001) and in MV patients (91.9% vs 77.7%, p<0.001), who required the prone position more frequently (74.8 vs 61%, p<0.001) and developed more infections. ICU and hospital mortality were increased in AKI patients (48.2% vs 17.7% and 51.1% vs 19%, p <0.001) respectively). AKI was an independent factor associated with mortality (IC 1.587-3.190). Mortality was higher in AKI patients who required RRT (55.8% vs 48.2%, p <0.04).

This study aimed to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 mortality, intensive care unit admission, intubation, and length of hospital stay among Jordanian patients. This was a one-year retrospective study of 745 COVID-19 patients admitted to Jordan University Hospital. Data regarding the patients’ demographics, clinical and co-morbid conditions, imaging, laboratory parameters, mortality, intensive care unit admission (ICU), and intubation were collected from their medical records using a coding manual. The data revealed that the overall rates of COVID-19-related mortality, ICU admission, and invasive intubation were 23.0%, 28.3%, and 10.8%, respectively. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), troponin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and O2 saturation <90% were significantly associated with the mortality rate. The variables that were significantly associated with ICU admission were heart failure and the use of remdesivir. However, O2 saturation <90% and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms were the only variables associated with invasive intubation.
